In a little over a week the federal government will reach
its debt ceiling of almost $17 trillion unless Congress raises the ceiling. I
am 99% confident that the ceiling will be raised in time to avoid a crisis. It
is difficult to see any useful purpose served by these ceilings. Indeed, I
will show why a focus on debt ceilings may even be harmful.

Federal debt is rising toward the present ceiling because
the government has been running a deficit between its spending and tax revenue.
The government has run a deficit practically every year for many decades, so
that Congress has been forced to raise the ceiling over 90 times during the
past 70 years, and 15 times since 1993 alone.

The financial burden of the federal debt depends not only on
the size of the debt, but also on the interest paid on the debt. The product of
the level of the debt and the interest rate essentially determines the
government revenue needed to service the debt. The low interest rates on
federal debt (and other debt) during the past decade have made it easier to
service even a growing debt. The burden of the debt to the economy also depends
on the size of the debt relative to GDP. Federal debt held by the public, including debt held overseas but excluding debt held by other government agencies, is about 70% of American GDP.

This debt ratio grew rapidly during the past five years
partly because federal spending increased greatly for most of this period, and
also partly because GDP has been growing slowly because of the lingering
recession. Still, a 70% debt to GDP ratio is much lower than the ratio in some
other developed countries. In Japan, this ratio is over 150%, and the ratio is
also higher in some European countries.

Many conservatives have liked having a debt ceiling, even
though it has been raised many times, because they believe a ceiling helps
limit federal deficits. This is why conservative members of Congress in 2011
were able to abolish the “Gephardt Rule". This rule stipulated that when the
House adopted a budget, a separate debt-limit vote was not necessary since the
ceiling automatically increased by enough to accommodate the spending implied
by the budget. Yet since deficits have been common even before the Gephardt
Rule was adopted in 1979, it is not apparent that having a separate vote on the
ceiling reduced the size of the deficits.

Conservatives who have supported a debt ceiling to reduce
deficits are really usually mainly concerned about the size of government.
However, government size depends not on deficits, but rather
fundamentally on the level of government spending. Since deficits can be
reduced either by cutting spending or raising taxes, both liberals and
conservatives can agree on the value of reducing deficits while strongly
disagreeing on how to reduce them. 
Liberals want to raise taxes to cut deficits, while conservatives want
to limit many kinds of government spending in order to reduce the size of the
government.

To the extent that debt ceilings mainly induce tax increases
to slow the growth in debt, a focus on debt ceilings and deficits does not help
rein in the size of government. Moreover, the substantial growth in federal
spending during the past 50 years under both Democratic and Republican control
of Congress and the presidency strongly suggests that the many debt ceilings
during this period did little to reduce the size of government. The numerous
deficits over this period even suggest that the ceiling has accomplished
little, if anything, in reducing deficits.

For those worried about the growth of government, there is
no substitute for a focus on the scale of government spending. Having debt
ceilings may not be completely innocuous because they may detract from that
focus.

I always find it odd when dept is compared to GDP. GDP lacks context.
Maybe a better fit is revenue and that would change quite a lot of things. Some european nations might have a high debt to GDP ratio but some of those are not very stable and some have a very solid debt/revenue ratio.
The US can't reach the level of taxation in the EU anytime soon and that makes the debt per GDP ratio irrelevant.
Sure we have the deficit but we don't include the backlog there.

(sorry if debt/revenue is already used ,i am not aware of it)
