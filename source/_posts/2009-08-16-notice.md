Wonderful to see your great hockey story from Minnesota, the 11th Canadian province and the land of pond hockey.

I'm the same as you about following hockey, but I live in Boston, so yay Bruins, and can we now return to normal?

Lovely, sensitive piece, Mary. Many of us, as kids, saw our parents as invulnerable, but when serious illness sets in, as it inevitable does, we see how human and vulnerable they really are.

A really touching piece, Mary. Yeah...I remember the first time I saw my dad scared. I was still a teenager and it petrified me.

Excellent tour, thanks very much! I feel the Keith Haring show would keep me enthralled for the day, and I would never get to the other galleries.
