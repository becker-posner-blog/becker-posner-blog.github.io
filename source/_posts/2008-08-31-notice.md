Darn! I was waiting all night in anticipation of their next blog post.  

Judge Posner - I didn't think you ever took a vacation:)

Perhaps Becker and Posner are as speechless as the rest of us following McCain's announcement of his running mate.

It's great to go on a vacation every once in awhile, but this creates something of a minor externality to all us who were anxiously awaiting this week's posting! It's like not getting the Sunday Times on the week-end.

This is EXCITING!  Becker and Posner on vacation!  Unheard of.  More so for Posner than Becker....yeah maybe Ken, Eric, Charlotte, and Dina will get to enjoy Posner's company for a change...and not at the Republican Convention either.
