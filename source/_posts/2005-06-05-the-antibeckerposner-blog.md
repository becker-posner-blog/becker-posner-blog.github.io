There is now an "Anti-Becker-Posner" blog, which comments on Becker's and my weekly postings. Its web address is http://www.anti-becker-posner.blogspot.com/.

### Comments

So that was supposed to be a place where "the community" can make whatever criticisms that one cannot make here (and how is that?).

Trouble is that the blog does not allow comments at this time. 

It looks like a joke is being played.

I think they just disable it for a day or two so they don't get a bunch of one-sentance garbage replies :).  Makes perfect sense to me.

Comments on the Anti-Becker-Posner blog will always be enabled unless the servers in question are down: a distinct possibility because both Blogger and Haloscan are totally unreliable.

Speaking of totally unreliable and Haloscan, does anyone know why I can't get the Anti-Becker-Posner-Blog to trackback here?

Excuse me. I was not a child prodigy, because a child prodigy is a child who knows as much when it is a child as it does when it grows up.
I am from Lithuania and also now am reading in English, tell me right I wrote the following sentence: "We provide quality workmanship prompt service.Unparalleled capital markets profiles of printed, buy side equity money manager directories."
