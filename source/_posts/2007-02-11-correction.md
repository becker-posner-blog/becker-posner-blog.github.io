The Branson-Gore Prize is of course $25 million, not $25! My apology for the mistake--Posner

It's not clear to me that being valued necessarily translates into a better life for a human being.  Valuable things, such as diamonds, tend to be kept close and locked up by their owners, and are prone to being stolen by others.  A society with fewer women may be a society where women are kept close, vulnerable to rape etc.  There is some sociological literature to this effect which might repay study.

Excuse me. Realize that true happiness lies within you. Waste no time and effort searching for peace and contentment and joy in the world outside. Remember that there is no happiness in having or in getting, but only in giving. Reach out. Share. Smile. Hug. Happiness is a perfume you cannot pour on others without getting a few drops on yourself.
I am from Vietnam and also now'm speaking English, please tell me right I wrote the following sentence: "Chicago style citation stewart, delma cheap white bunk beds."

Thank :D Gary.
