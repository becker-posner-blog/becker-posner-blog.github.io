The 40 year-old American “war on drugs” has been a colossal
failure. No progress in dealing with drugs can be expected until that basic
truth is recognized. Every conceivable approach has been tried to help the war
succeed, such as long prison terms for persons convicted of selling or using
drugs, trying to prevent drugs from entering the US from Mexico and other
countries, and confiscating huge quantities of drugs (remember The French
Connection?). At some point all wars that fail are terminated, and alternative
approaches explored.

The two main alternatives to the war on drugs are decriminalization
and legalization of drugs. Decriminalizing drugs means that using drugs would
no longer be a criminal activity, while trafficking in drugs would remain a
crime. Legalization of drugs means that trafficking in drugs as well as using
drugs would not be a crime.

With decriminalization, individuals in possession of small
quantities of drugs would not be subject to criminal charges, so that they need
not fear imprisonment or other punishments. Since eliminating any criminal
punishment for using drugs reduces the effective cost of using drugs,
decriminalization might increase experimentation with drug use.

At the same time, however, decriminalization might well
reduce the fraction of drug users who regularly consume large quantities of
drugs, which is usually a sign of drug addiction. The likelihood of becoming
and remaining addicted to drugs or other goods is not determined only by
personal biological and psychological propensities to become addicted. For
example, many individuals end their addictions to smoking and drinking alcohol
when they get married, find good jobs, or mature.

The war on drugs makes it much more difficult for
individuals who are unhappy about their addictions to cocaine or other drugs to
end their addictions. When using drugs is a criminal offense, drug addicts who
want to quit hesitate going to drug clinics, or seeking other help, because
they are subject to arrest. Although decriminalizing drugs makes it easier to
experiment with using drugs, it also encourages the development of for-profit
and non-profit organizations that help individuals terminate their reliance on
cocaine, heroin, and other addictive drugs. Since smoking and drinking are
legal, the non-profit organization AA could develop to help heavy drinkers end
their addiction, and profit-making companies had the incentive to create
patches to help individuals stop smoking.

The evidence from Portugal, a country that decriminalized
all drug use in 2001, offers some support for the claim that decriminalization
of drug use will reduce addiction to drugs. A 2010 study in the British Journal
of Criminology concluded that decriminalization in Portugal reduced
imprisonment on drug-related charges, only slightly increased, if at all, drug
experimentation among young persons, increased visits to clinics that help end
drug addictions, and reduced deaths from drug overdoses.

As Posner indicates, a growing number of states have
decriminalized the use of marijuana for medical purposes, and a couple of
states have decriminalized all uses of marijuana. Effectively, if not legally,
marijuana has been decriminalized in a large number of American states, despite
its violation of federal law.

Decriminalizing drug use does lead to decriminalization of
some drug trafficking as well since some sellers of drugs would only keep small
quantities of drugs on their persons in order to claim, if questioned by the
police, that they are users rather than sellers of drugs. Still,
decriminalization would not by itself end many of the costs of the war on drugs
since they involve actions against large-scale traffickers. Only full
legalization of the selling as well as consuming of drugs could do that. As
Kevin Murphy and I said elsewhere (Wall Street Journal, Jan.5, 2013), “full
decriminalization on both sides of the drug market would lower drug prices,
reduce the role of criminals in producing and selling drugs, improve many
inner-city neighborhoods, encourage more minority students in the U.S. to
finish high school, lessen the drug problems of Mexico and other countries
involved in supplying drugs {to the U.S.}, greatly reduce the number of federal
and state prisoners and the harmful effects on drug offenders of spending many
years in jail, and save the financial resources of government”.

In most countries, including the United States, smoking and
drinking are rather heavily taxed through so-called “sin taxes”. For those
concerned that legalizing drugs would greatly increase the use of drugs,
legalization could be combined with a tax on drugs, like these other sin taxes.
Some drug transactions might move underground to avoid paying this tax, but
most production would remain legal because of the many contractual and other
advantages of legally producing drugs.

The retreat from the war on drugs has already begun. The
question is whether it will be a sensible retreat with systematic changes in
the law toward decriminalization and legalization of drugs, or a disorganized
retreat that leaves users and sellers of drugs with unclear legal status.

Yes the war on drugs is a failure.  The discouragement of drug use is laudable.
Enforcement should continue on the trafficking and distribution level but discontinue on the user level. The product and profits captured from the enforcement of trafficking and distribution could be used to stock complimentary neighborhood dispensaries. This would set up a tension between the "for-profit" and "non-profit" dynamics that would take the cash incentives out of the trafficking and distribution. 
Drug testing must be instituted for recipients of government subsidized housing and other safety net programs.
