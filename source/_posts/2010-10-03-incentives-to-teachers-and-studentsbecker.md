The traditional public school system had a very weak
incentive structure. Since students automatically went to neighborhood schools,
schools did not have to compete for students. The teachers unions long ago
eliminated merit pay, and made
teachers’ pay determined almost entirely by degrees and years spent teaching.
Finally, in this traditional system, students had little incentive to work
hard, especially when they did not expect to get much education, and could
count on always getting promoted.

All this is beginning to change for the better, despite
fierce opposition from teachers unions to virtually every important reform.
School vouchers, and especially the charter school movement, is bringing
competition to the traditional neighborhood school. No longer can public
schools automatically have a captive audience of all the school age children in
their neighborhood. Charter schools are expanding as rapidly as allowed by
local and state restrictions that have been due mainly to lobbying of
teachers unions.

Fortunately, restrictions on charter schools, and the even
greater limits imposed on the scope of school vouchers, are breaking down, in
large part because parents are becoming vocal, and are also voting with the
feet of their children. In addition, careful evaluations of charter schools in
randomized experiments that compare the performance on standardized tests of
students in charter schools to performance by students in regular public
schools generally show that charter school students do significantly better
(see, for example, studies by Josh Angrist of MIT and co-authors of charter
schools in and near Boston).

Some progress has also been made in finding ways to better
motivate students, even in traditional public schools. A large and mainly well
designed experiment of poor rural children in Mexico that began in the 1990s,
originally called Progresa (now called Oportunidades), showed that even young
children from uneducated families could be better motivated by financial
incentives. Progresa gave monthly stipends to mothers of children in the program
if they attended school regularly and did decently. School attendance
did rise for families participating in this program, and students stayed in
school longer.

Experiments are now ongoing in American public schools by my
colleagues Steve Levitt and John List, along with Roland Fryer of Harvard, on
motivating students by giving financial rewards directly to students rather
than to parents. Although the studies are not yet completed, I would anticipate
that students, especially older students, could be well motivated by monetary
and other rewards for good performance.

Not surprisingly, teachers unions fight hardest against
reforms that change the way teachers are paid, especially when they introduce
incentives for teachers to perform more effectively. Teachers’ pay should tend
to depend on education and experience, but it should also be sensitive to their
revealed effectiveness as teachers. Teachers unions have for many decades
fought merit pay that allows principals and other administrators to determine “merit” by
their evaluations of how well teachers perform. The unions have claimed that
this approach to merit would give higher pay not to teachers who do the best
teaching, but to teachers who ingratiate themselves into the good graces of the
administrators. Perhaps that argument has some merit in the traditional school
system where administrators of neighborhood schools have some monopoly power,
but it is far less compelling as administrators of public schools increasingly
have to compete for students by offering better education.

In any case, the call now is for merit pay based on more
objective criteria, such as students’ performance on standardized tests. Since
students differ greatly in how well prepared they are for particular classes
and subject matter, it is crucial to design a merit pay system that ties pay
not to the absolute level of performance, but to the increment in performance
added by different teachers. It may also be desirable to try to reduce
“teaching to the test”, whereby teachers only emphasize materials that are
included in the tests used to determine merit pay, although teaching to the
test is valuable if doing well on the “test” requires knowledge of the
important principles.

I do not want to minimize the difficulty of getting a well-designed
system of merit pay, and Posner discusses many such difficulties. However, my
colleague, Derek Neal, has proposed an attractive system of merit pay, where
student performance at the end of the year is compared to that of students who
perform about as well at the beginning of the year. Essentially, teachers then
get a bonus that depends on the percentile ranking of their students at
year-end compared with the performance of the comparable students. Other
education specialists have different ways to determine merit pay that may be
worth considering.

The disgraceful reaction of the LA teachers union to
publication by the LA Times of the database that gives performance scores of
the students of 6000 elementary school teachers is indicative of how teachers unions
feel toward rewarding better teachers. The support by Arne Duncan, the US
Secretary of Education, of the newspaper’s publication of this information is
highly commendable. Not only should such information be published and
publicized, but they should also be used to design a system where merit plays a
sizable part in the monetary compensation of teachers.

Yay!  Letting kids take 1/2 of the money the school is given for their education as a voucher if they go to a different school would be my call.  But school reform is so needed now imo.  Glad to hear you guys are on it.

It's amazing.  To identify effective educational reforms, all one need do is target the proposals the teachers' unions oppose.

Odd. All the research I know suggests that external rewards and punishments undercut internal motivation, at least for higher-order thinking tasks. They are, on the other hand, effective for lower-level thinking tasks such as rote memorization. I would argue we want to promote higher-level thinking in our schools.

In addition, my understanding is that research also shows that value-added measurements are not up to the task of discerning highly effective from ineffective teachers - that teachers' scores (or more precisely the scores of teachers' students) can vary wildly from year to year, and even after averaging together results for a decade there is only 92% reliability. 

I certainly agree we should not be teaching to the test, and find other areas of agreement with your article as well. But (as a non-union teacher, not that it should matter) I did want to introduce this research into the discussion.

This article is just plain DUMB and adds nothing to the resolution of a very difficult equation. It is just the usual teacher bashing. I attended public schools. I was poor. I attended college and advanced to receive a professional degree. None of my teachers were Rhodes scholars, but the Board of Education and politicians left them alone to teach. They provided the students every opportunity to learn. In retrospect, they were underpaid, and as I grew older I realized that their pensions were meager. Fortunately, teachers now are paid more appropriately in recognition of their critical position in society. This raises an interesting issue: Does bashing teachers actually destroy their motivation? Do any of these "experts" such as Arne Duncan have any real experience, education or training for their positions? I have great respect for those who enter the teaching profession. Most are initially well motivated. If you want to conduct a real world experiment to determine whether the so called "best" teachers can dramatically change the outcomes for marginal students, we should identify such supposedly superior teachers and place them in the schools with the lowest achieving students. For example, take teachers with six figure salaries from the wealth northwest suburbs of Chicago and place them in the intercity schools of Chicago with the lowest achieving students. Then we would actually have results. Until someone does so, without culling the best students from public schools and having them attend charter or private schools, we will never know. And, what about the special education students? Where do they go? Do we have special charter schools for them too? A huge part of public education budgets go toward serving these students. How many attend private schools? How many are in charter schools? Leave these issues to those who have studied them. For economics professors in their Ivy League towers to chime in accomplishes nothing. Richard Posner is right to admit that he is "unclear" with regard to these matters. Neither article adds anything to a very difficult subject. As Mr. Posner notes, good students from good social backgrounds achieve higher scores. This much is clear. As for other students, there is not nor has there been during my 62 years of life any clear answer.

Hi,
Since I am working as Assistant Professor, I believe teachers should get bonus or get an applause at least.
To motivate them for adopting better teaching techniques, the administration should arrange seminars, conferences or workshops, even some specialized courses should be arranged.
Thanks

Much of the debate on merit pay has been focused on designing test scores and basing pay of of those scores. Has anybody ever considered giving school boards more incentive to motivate teachers and students? 
I question whether the increase in test scores attributed to charter schools and voucher programs is worth the money, time, and parental confusion that will be needed to implement and maintain such a program.

If I may make a practical suggestion:  Devil take the hindmost. Let say 3% per year be subject to firing, criteria to be negotiated between the union and the employer. Surely, a union can't object to its worst 3% being liable to firing, or to put it the other way, can't justify forcing the employer to retain the worst 3% of their employees. 

Since nobody will want to be in the lowest 3%, this will create incentive to a certain minimum performance, an incentive that will increase with time, as the very worst are progressively culled.

I should say the post is not debatable and truly great! Teachers should be given real attention and one way to give this is through incentives/bonuses. It will help them to strive more and upgrade learning to be more productive and competent.

I think the bonus depends on the student's teacher, is a good proposal, contrary to outstanding students also should get the school's bonus
