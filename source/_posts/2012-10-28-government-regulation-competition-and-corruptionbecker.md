Many believe that competition leads to a race to the bottom,
where cheating of customers and other forms of corrupt behavior prevail because of
competitive pressures. However, if repeat business is important for a company’s
profitability, and if customers are aware of when they are cheated or are the
victims of other unethical behavior by companies, competition tends to
eliminate corrupt companies and promotes companies that behave honestly toward
consumers. The reason is that corrupt companies will have little repeat
business, and by assumption that would crush their profit prospects.

When repeat business is of little importance, as in many
tourist centers, corrupt businessmen have much better chances of surviving and
even thriving. It is in these cases that honest businessmen have trouble doing
well because they are outcompeted by corrupt businessmen. Tourists do not have
sufficient incentives to invest in knowledge of the reputations of local
businessmen since they usually do not return to the same locality. In that
case, their unhappy experience with cheaters would not affect their future
behavior very much.

Unfortunately, the empirical evidence is limited on the
relation between the degree of competition in an industry and its degree of
corruption. Part of the reason for the scarcity of reliable information is that
empirical studies of competitiveness do not tend to account for how important
repeat business is, and the interaction between regulation and competitiveness.

One widely cited study on international corruption is
Transparency International’s annual ranking of countries by the degree of
corruption among government officials (its Corruption Perception Index). New
Zealand, Denmark, Finland, Sweden, and Singapore head the list, while Sudan,
Turkestan, North Korea, and Somalia are at the bottom. Some countries at the
top have large governments, such as Norway and Sweden, but all the top
countries have rather competitive economies, certainly much more competitive
than countries at the bottom. These international comparisons do not indicate
that competition leads to greater corruption, when corruption is measured by
corruption of government officials.

While these indexes show that government officials are more
corrupted in some countries than in others countries, greater regulation and
government control in an industry often induces more corrupt practices in that
industry. Companies that are successful at bribing or otherwise influencing
officials to gain extra business or other advantages clearly are more likely to
survive such competition. Of course, the advantage to corrupt business behavior
would be eliminated if all officials and lawmakers were completely honest, but
that is far from always the case.

Numerous examples are available of the advantages to
businesses from corrupting regulators and other government officials. Fannie
Mae and Freddie Mac, quesi-private companies, engaged in various corrupt
practices during the housing boom in order to gain added business (see the
expose of these companies in “Reckless Endangerment” by Morgenson and Rossner).
Chinese government officials are accused of widespread corrupt practices as they
allocate valuableland and capital to different companies.

From this perspective, the banking industry may well be more
corrupt than the average industry not because it is reasonably competitive, but
partly because it is highly regulated. Banks gain financially if they can
induce regulators and others officials to give them advantages in the
enforcement of the many complicated regulations that govern modern banking.

Corruption in the banking industry is also induced by the
large quantities of money that that they receive in trust from depositors and
others. Some regulations have undoubtedly protected lenders to banks from
corrupt practices by bankers, although not sufficiently to prevent various
highly suspect banking practices during the run up to the financial crisis. Still,
an expansion of certain rules-based regulations of the banking industry has
been warranted, such as greater capital requirements relative to bank assets.

In any case, my discussion indicates that the corruption of
businessmen depends mainly on the importance of repeat business in a
competitive environment, the ability of companies to influence the decisions of
lawmakers and regulators, and the magnitude of the liquid assets of customers that are
entrusted to companies.

I feel like you're seemingly overlooking one of your own observations - "if repeat business is important for a company’s profitability, and if customers are aware of when they are cheated or are the victims of other unethical behavior by companies, competition tends to eliminate corrupt companies" - unfortunately finance/banking is such a layered industry... This often has the effect of making it impossible for a customer to be aware of corrupt and unethical practices. In most cases, the typical consumer is a broker and a fund manager away from the actual operations of whatever financial vehicle they are investing in. This very fact likely contributes highly to unethical behavior since the bad actors remain essentially anonymous from the end-user.

Posner is correct in saying that competition drove banks to ever riskier behavior. That risky behavior did not necessarily consist of making riskier loans. The banks were all driven to use more and more leverage, and when mortgages proved to be riskier than thought, that proved disastrous. The Basel standards had classified mortgages as nearly as safe as sovereign debt.

Is the banking system more corrupt because of more regulation, or is it the other way around?
