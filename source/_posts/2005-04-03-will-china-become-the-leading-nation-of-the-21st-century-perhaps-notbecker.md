NOTE: Posner and I believe that we should place more emphasis on  events of interest to the international community. So we will discuss international issues more frequently, starting with our entries on China.


China�s economic growth since it freed agriculture from the oppressive hand of government has been spectacular, averaging some 7-10 per cent per year in real GDP since 1980, even allowing for some inflation in the official numbers. It has becoming a leading destination of foreign investment, one of the world�s biggest exporters, and among the largest users of oil and other natural resources.

Its potential seems to be so limitless, after awakening from a slumber that lasted for centuries, that many are already forecasting that China will replace the United States during the 21st century as the leading economic power. Perhaps these forecasts will be correct-my crystal ball is very cloudy- but some cautionary comments are needed because we have heard that tune before. 

The �German miracle� after World War II was so impressive that many forecast Germany would overtake the United States rather quickly, in part because Germany supposedly discovered a new way to organize economic society- a � social contract� among workers and companies- that would propel that nation past America�s old fashioned capitalism. But Germany began to flounder in the 1980�s, did much worse in the 1990�s, and is considered by many now to be the �sick man� of the European Union.

 Krushchev�s prophesy in the late 1950�s that the USSR would �bury� the US was not about military victory but economic superiority. This was made when Soviet official statistics showed extremely rapid economic growth. The apparent miracle of Soviet growth suggested to the great economists Joseph Schumpeter and Paul Samuelson, and many others that central planning might be superior economically to capitalism and decentralization of economic power.

The latest case prior to China is Japan, which experienced impressive economic growth from the early 1950�s into the late �80�s that propelled Japan into the elite club of the richest economic powers. Japan too had supposedly discovered a new approach of consensus capitalism with a long-term business outlook that was allegedly superior to old Adam Smith varieties of competitive capitalism. This alleged superiority of the Japanese system was extolled in a series of articles by the very good economist Alan Blinder, and in books with various titles, such as �The Japan That Can Say No�. Yet Japan basically stagnated since the early 1990�s, and now the concern is whether it can ever come out of this stagnation and deflation (I am confident it will eventually). It�s economic  model now seems riddled with inefficiencies and drawbacks, and is no longer considered a new wave of capitalism.

None of this proves that China will not be an exception, and continue to grow well beyond other nations, but these examples do suggest caution in conceding the next 50 years or so to China�s economy. Countries invariably discover that it is much easier to grow rapidly when they are economically way behind since they could then import the knowledge embodied in technology and human capital developed by leading countries. As a country begins to catch up to the knowledge frontier, a simple transfer of knowledge is no longer productive. It then has to participate in the generation of new technologies and approaches, which is far harder than simply using advances made elsewhere.

To be sure, China has considerable strengths that should enable it to grow relatively rapidly for much longer. China has an abundant, hard-working, and ambitious labor force. The government also radically liberalized the incredibly rigid labor markets under its old style central planning toward flexible markets that allow companies to hire and fire easily. Also workers now have the freedom, they did not before, to find jobs that best suit their talents and interests. China has opened its economy to foreign investments and domestic entreprenuers, something the Soviet Union, Japan, or even Germany never really did, and China has been learning from the new technologies brought by these investors. 

China has also created a highly competitive environment in most markets, where companies have flexibility to change prices as costs change, and as competitors alter their prices and terms of sale. China�s long history of great respect for knowledge and scholars has returned. Even poor families now sacrifice their meager resources to insure their children a decent education and other investments in human capital.

During the past couple of decades, China has been blessed with far-sighted leaders that have generally wisely approached liberalizing its economy. They started off with relatively simple steps that gave farmers greater freedom to decide what to produce on their small private plots, and to sell their output at more market-based prices. After seeing the overwhelming success of these first steps, they gradually liberalized much of the rest of the economy, allowing workers freedom to choose jobs, employers freedom to determine hiring and firing, markets freedom to set most wages and prices, foreign investors to start factories, often in partnership with local governments, and stock exchanges to develop in Shanghai and elsewhere. Meanwhile, the mainland has largely lived up to its agreement to give considerable economic autonomy to Hong Kong. 

This rapid development of the Chinese economy has provided many benefits to the US and other rich economies. Chinese has exported clothing, toys, simple electronics, and many other labor-intensive goods at prices far below those possible without China�s development. China�s growth helps provide a much larger and richer market for the knowledge-intensive products and services produced by rich nations, such as cars, computers, drugs and medical instruments, kitchen appliances, and many others.

China�s development so far poses economic problems mainly not for the advanced nations, but for developing nations that produce the same types of labor-intensive products as China does. These nations include Mexico, Pakistan, Brazil, and some countries of Africa. It is a general but sometimes neglected result in trade theory that the growth of a large nation will raise world GDP per capita, but can hurt the nations that are most similar to the growing nation. 

Richer nations could be hurt eventually if China continues to move up the product ladder. It would then produce and export more knowledge-intensive products, partly made possible by China�s disrespect for property rights, intellectual property, and patent protection laws. But even so, I believe that rich nations will generally benefit from China�s progress since different richer nations generally specialize in different types and varieties of products and services. Moreover, as China gets richer, it will provide even larger markets for exports from other nations.

But to return to the main theme, as with Russia, Germany, and Japan, it is not inevitable that China will continue to grow rapidly enough to equal or surpass eventually the growing per capita incomes of the US and Western Europe. For like the other nations that looked unstoppable, China has serious problems, and other problems might surface as it becomes richer.

China has a disastrous capital market, with government banks that have been forced to make loans to inefficient public companies. The result has been hundreds of billions of dollars of debt that will never be repaid, and are now being auctioned off. Perhaps that debt overhang will be rapidly absorbed, but Japan suffered for more than decade with a huge supply of bad bank debt that they did not absorb efficiently; indeed, the government has continued to encourage the creation of more bad debt.

China still has many highly inefficient public enterprises that authorities are reluctant to close because they fear discontent from laid off workers. These enterprises can stay in business only because they receive uneconomic loans from other state enterprises; namely, the banks. China does not have a developed system of commercial laws, and shows little respect for intellectual property rights. This may well be a rational strategy for a developing nation that is mainly using knowledge originated elsewhere, but this strategy becomes a drawback as a country becomes richer, and must begin to participate itself in the production of new knowledge.

Authoritarian regimes can do well economically when they have good leaders, but they can produce disasters when these leaders have foolish economic ideas. China discovered this under Mao, with his incredible �great leap forward� that helped kill millions of rural Chinese. While the evidence indicates that authoritarian regimes do not grow slower on average than democratic governments, they do have more unstable growth rates than democracies. I believe China will become more democratic if it continues to grow rapidly, but economic progress could falter badly if they select poor leaders who have strange ideas about how economies should be organized.

China has had a much faster decline in birth rates to below-replacement levels than other developing nations, no doubt helped by its so-called one child policy. This has meant a prematurely aging population that creates a burden on its evolving social security and health systems as relatively few young persons one way or another have to �finance� the care of increasing numbers of elderly. 

The rapid fertility decline also greatly slowed its population growth, which may have looked attractive in a poor Malthusian-style economy. But knowledge-based economies often thrive on larger populations because of what economists call increasing returns to scale in the production of new knowledge, and in the degree of specialization in different types of human capital. While exports to the world�s population provide some offsets to declines in a country�s population, domestic populations are much more important usually in determining the advantages of investments in knowledge and human capital.

A more intangible but important factor is that as countries get richer, they often introduce policies that retard further progress. This happened in Germany with legislation that made labor very costly, and ossified its labor and retirement markets. It happened in Japan that kept many regulatory restrictions on services, on foreign investments and immigration, and maintained a protected and inefficient banking system. It can surely happen also in China in ways that are difficult to forecast at this early stage of its development.

I am not saying that China will not become the leading economic nation, but rather that it is far too early to tell. The many failed predictions about Japan and other nations should make us modest about such long-term predictions. Perhaps India will become the leader-it has strengths (and weaknesses) that China lacks- or maybe Brazil if it can finally get its act together. 

Or indeed, perhaps the US will continue to be the most dynamic economy. Many economists and others wrote off this economy during the 1970�s and some of the �80�s when productivity growth declined and the economy faltered. Since I do not believe countries necessarily age the way species do, the US can continue to do well- productivity started growing rapidly about 10 years ago- if it provides a good environment for new companies, flexible labor and product markets, sizeable investments in human capital and technology, and an open attitude to new ideas, immigrants, and different ways. Those of you alive in 20-30 years will be able to discover if my skepticism and analysis will be borne out by events.

I completely agree with the argument. In spite of the positives changes happening in terms of labor law, competition, openness to foreign investment, etc. there is a fundamental missing link for the growth of private enterprise, i.e. entrepreneurship. Does China have a class of enterpreneurs, or risk takers that can provide entrepreneurial skills to setting up and running successful businesses of all types and sizes. Experience from India shows that easy availability of capital is neither a sufficient nor a necessary condition for the growth of entrepreneurial talent that invest in projects chosen from a set of competing projects. It would be interesting to see how many of the private enterprises are profitable, their source of capital and the returns on investment.

In fairness to Germany, they did have to absorb their Communist half.  How well would the U.S. do if it was suddenly "reuntied" with Russia?


I wonder if in some ways China isn't already ahead of us.  With a large rural population at least surviving, workers who lose their jobs in the "new" economy can go home and pitch in on the family farm to survive instead of depending on government handouts. With 98% of Americans living off the farm these days, we don't have that option anymore.

I think your comment on China's banking system is most important.  China can 'cheat' its way to prosperity by ignoring patent law but the ill-gotten gains of any robber go for naught if placed outside a sound banking system.  The Orient, with its 'face-saving' traditions, is not prepared to operate banks properly.  China will grow quickly and then plateau like the Japanese.

Several writers have speculated that China will take military action against Taiwan after the 2008 Olympics.  If China's banks are in deep trouble after the Olympics, we can probably expect a military crackdown inside China as well.

In the end, I predict that America's trade deficit with China will be a money maker for USA.  Remember this: Japan was flush with cash and bought Rockefeller Center for a huge premium only to sell it back to the prior owners at a huge loss.

Becker's comment on the financing of China's state-owned industries is important and worthy of elaboration.

Popular press accounts of China's refusal to allow an appreciation of its currency against the dollar have focused on the export-driven nature of China's growth -- though dollar assets do not provide an especially good return on investment, a relatively strong dollar keeps millions of Chinese employed in industries that export to the American market.  Do we know, though, to what extent foreign exchange earnings are now being recycled as loans to inefficient state-owned enterprises?

Although the matter is not quite so simple, we're talking about the difference between good investments and bad ones -- between taking on American debt in ways that make future Chinese economic growth possible and acquiring American dollars only to flush them down a rathole.  As Becker says, the obvious analogy is to the poor use Japan made of the large trade supluses it ran with the United States in the 1980s.  However, I will confess to not having a good handle on how much of China's trade surplus is now (or how much is projected to being in the future) recycled in the form of bad loans to state-owned industries.  I'd be glad if someone could provide some data to shed light on this point.

still reading but couldn't let this comment stand:

"Richer nations could be hurt eventually if China continues to move up the product ladder. It would then produce and export more knowledge-intensive products, partly made possible by China�s disrespect for property rights, intellectual property, and patent protection laws."

Ummm... does anyone recall US treatment of (mainly British) intellectual property rights in the 19th century?

Great topic and it's always good to be skeptical toward predictions of future.  The world should very much be concerned about China as an influential actor in global affairs, long before China achieves, if ever, any economic pre-eminence.


It is clear that China's government will have to play a central role in any successes or failures to come.  For every inherent disadvantage, China has inherent advantages.  The key shouldn't be a focus on any inherent limits on China's growth, but whether the Chinese government can manage a smooth transition to modernization without one or more of the social upheavals that China is historically known for.


It might be helpful to note, too, that China is coming of age at the same time as the rest of the world is experiencing globalization of a sort more rapid and intense than globalizing periods of the past.  Whether or not China succeeds and what the limits to China's growth are will depend as much on international events and global trends as much as any factors specific to China.  Increasingly, the ships of the world's economies rise and fall on the same tides.


Lastly, is it China's economy we are really worried about, or China's direction and influence?  My point is that our indicators of economic development are only one set of measures when it comes to matters of global power and relevance.  It would appear that to have influence in the 21st century, a country needs attitude more than ability.  With regard to raw exercise of power, rich countries will likely become increasingly risk adverse in the future, so a rising power like China does not need to attain real economic or military power on par with the US in order to make real trouble for the US or others, if it so chose to.




BTW, yes, China has banking and financial sector challenges, and yes, I would agree that there are some cultural barriers to overcome if China is to fully meet current international financial norms, but don't try to use the culture argument with the Chinese in Hong Kong, Singapore, London, Vancouver, Taipei, New York, Sydney, etc.

The United States should probably be somewhat ambivalent about Chinese growth, since economic growth is accompanied by increased political and military clout.  On the other hand, is it possible that the real prize isn't democracy or US military dominance, but English?  If America is to maintain its economic and academic centrality, we probably want English (or maybe Spanish) to be the language of business and academia for a long time.  Written Chinese is at least comprehensible to Japanese people, so if China and Japan together become economically dominant, we might find ourselves at a disadvantage.

Just one point. The population of China is four times that of the United States, and will remain nearly that much larger even if it declines. That means that China's GDP could considerably exceed that of the US, even if its per capita income is much smaller.

I am surprized to see not mention of civil rights.
Two questions: would a society with a huge GDP and huge per capita income be successful if the majority of the people were slaves (not that this is the case in China, but the question is: how important is freedom in comparision to GDP?).  And, how does freedom of speach, due process of law, and etc. support economic growth?

One point I found interesting was made by Becker's colleague Tom Evans. China is a strong net lender on world markets and has a very high savings rate compared to more advanced economies. It seems like this is a quite pessimistic statement by Chinese markets themselves about future growth: countries (such as the US) with expectations of almost eternal growth borrow and spend at extremely high rates because they are confident in future growth, while those which are net lenders (such as Japan in the 1980's) seem to be saying "this is as good as it will get for us." It would seem China falls more into the second category at this point.

As for China's future, just wait until the continent of Africa comes on line and every one jumps for the lower wage scale, multiple tax incentives, and interest free loans. Funny how history repeats itself. 

Perhaps the IWW's time has finally arrived.

Being a native Chinese, I think it is really a good article to read. Even 30 minutes reading is worthy. For me, however, there is one exception of "good":

"Richer nations could be hurt eventually if China continues to move up the product ladder."

If US keeps thinking the global economy in this way, then there will always be a problem...Personally, I don't like any economy problem tighted with political issues, although they are always together. Actually, there is one thing in American's mind: "we are the best one in this world"... if American don't know how to live in this world as the "second" one, then... that day will come eventually anyway.

Thank you for this good article though.

Professor Becker, since you're going to be addressing more international topics, have you considered discussing de Soto's work on the importance of formalizing property rights and recent critiques? Slate recently published a scathing review, see http://slate.msn.com/Default.aspx?id=2112792&, that might be worth a response.

hyh is right.  Intellectual property is created by a state to promote the state's interests.  Weak IP regimes are a good deal for net IP importer countries.

The problem with China is that there are IP laws on the books which are not followed. Foriegn companies don't have the IP protections they think they do.  This goes down to chinese companies ignoring contractual agreements not to copy.

I would expect that problems such as lax IP laws will gain in rigidity as the acession of China to the WTO becomes more complete--and assuming the WTO gets on the ball and holds China accountable.

I also have a suggestion for an internationally focused conversation.

Thomas P.M. Barnett wrote an article for Esquire magazine last year entitled "The Pentagon's New Map," in which he described what he believes is the new security environment that the U.S. finds itself in today. 

In this article he suggested that the War Department was planning for the wrong war because it had not identified the enemy or his goals.

Barnett's map shows a swath of poverty stretching from Central America through Africa the Middle East and Central Asia.  His point (my opinion) was that terrorist were not trying to export their philsophy to the US, but were trying to keep information access out of their poverty belt.  They are trying to maintain positions of control and dominence.

I've paraphrased this, but thought it was a provocative article.   I valued it because of the way maps were used to show where poverty is most concentrated. These are the areas of the world where help is needed if societies are to change.  I use Internet based maps of Chicago to show where poverty and poorly performing schools are located, and where volunteers, business partners and philanthropy are needed.   

Can you comment on Barnett's "new map" theory?  Here's a link to the site:  http://www.thomaspmbarnett.com/published/pentagonsnewmap.htm

Thank you.

I too would like to hear the Becker-Posner perspective on Thomas Barnett's " Theory of a Peacefully Rising China"

http://www.thomaspmbarnett.com/weblog/archives2/000764.html

( scroll toward the lower half of the post)

My two cents on China's role in the 21st century:

China's rise has been forecast for a very long time - going back to Brooks Adams in 1900 and the advocates of the Open Door policy. Even Napoleon a century earlier discerned China's potential as a sleeping dragon.

My expectation is that while China will become a great power in 30-50 years the current regime will not be around to enjoy it.  

Beijing's political legitimacy now depends upon the deivery of extremely high real growth rates in GDP in the realm of 8-11 %. This is simply not sustainable forever and when the economy hits a major recession the noveau bourgeois of the cities will become restive and the government is going to fall unless it has reformed in the interim to become more representative.

China's history has been one of centrifugal forces - China's provinces usually form regional economies - in tension with central political control. Economic divergence between the 200-300 million Chinese citizens who enjoy a modernizing, urban economy and the 700 million + peasantry who are on the periphery is widening. The regime's use of nationalism as a centripetal counterweight has helped but that too carries risks ( to try to take Taiwan and fail may be to reprise the Falklands War).

re: de Soto / Slate

The Slate critique attempts to measure new loans against property / improvements enabled by granting title to squatters.  My sense (from studying the westward migration in the US and land grants) is there's seldom this form of immediately realized value, though property will tend to be sold to those who manage it "best" (and value will be realized at that first sale).  What it does do is start to break down the caste/local-strongman/governor hard- and soft-corruption that prevents the maturing of a civil-society (because of the shear volume of transactions enabled by granting title) (which is where real productivity gains happen as individual decisions supplant government).  

I'm reminded that the only slums in the US exist in the presence of aggressive zoning and land-use regulation.  Remove the government and the slums evaporate, and the poor do find a way (which sometimes means we find 10 adults and 20 children in a single home - generating enough income at minimum wage to create a nest-egg sufficient to buy a convenience store, assuming a government doesn't also persecute the poor by outlawing this type of cooperation / cohabitation in even expensive areas).  And even in expensive areas, a person can work for one week (at minimum wage), and be able to buy a simple but nutritious diet of mostly rice-and-beans for 3-6 months.

re: more people working.

Is always good, irrespective of them "gaming the system".  Simple arithmetic, right?  No downside - other than if those of us affected by competition have NOT been taught young that change is guaranteed, that there are no positive welfare rights, and that we must learn to embrace change and love learning, which means we must open a book or practice a new skill regularly.

re: IPR protection.


Is no more or less a government issue than the amount of civil-society we depend on to protect the fruit-vendor's unattended cart.  If civility is high, overhead costs are low and productivity higher (than otherwise).  If not, intellect and sweat will focus where there are greater rewards.   
I was in Vietnam a few years ago and was party to a leadership conversation where they wondered why they weren't a larger force in the software business (given how successful their immigrants to the US have been).  I pointed out that they had little computer shops at every corner but all they were (able) to sell was hardware, since they chose to pirate software.  Which meant that every company in Vietnam that needed localized solutions had to do it themselves or buy it from the first world. Which I pointed out was their largest import (as services).  A pity, I observed, given I had hired many immigrant Vietnamese and they were often the smartest and most productive of all my employees. I recommend they take half that services trade imbalance and use it to encourage and underwrite their businesses (starting w/ state business) buying "things intellectual" and suggested that in ten years they'd find themselves a net exporter.  To all of our benefit.
