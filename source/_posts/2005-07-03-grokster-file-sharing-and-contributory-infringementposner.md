On the last day of its term (June 27), the Supreme Court decided the Grokster case, holding that the court of appeals had erred in affirming summary judgment for Grokster, a company that distributes free of charge software that enables computer owners to form "peer-to-peer" networks whereby a copy of a file in one computer can be transmitted to another computer. (There was another defendant as well, but I'll ignore that detail.) As explained in the Court‚Äôs majority opinion, "On the FastTrack network opened by the Grokster software, the user's request goes to a computer given an indexing capacity by the software and designated a supernode, or to some other computer with comparable power and capacity to collect temporary indexes of the files available on the computers of users connected to it. The supernode (or indexing computer) searches its own index and may communicate the search request to other supernodes. If the file is found, the supernode discloses its location to the computer requesting it, and the requesting user can download the file directly from the computer located. The copied file is placed in a designated sharing folder on the requesting user's computer, where it is available for other users to download in turn, along with any other file in that folder."

Grokster was sued by owners of music and film copyrights, who complained that Grokster was facilitating the infringement of their copyrights. Instead of buying a CD or DVD, the owner of Grokster software could search the network composed of other owners of the software for a computer file containing the copyrighted music or film and if he found it copy the file. This would be infringement, and the Supreme Court ruled that there was enough evidence of "contributory infringement" by Grokster to warrant a trial. The Court was unanimous, but there are several opinions, and they are long and labored. The basic principles are simple, however, and a single, much shorter opinion would have sufficed.

A contributory infringer is someone who facilitates infringement. By making the contributory infringer liable, the law reduces the cost of enforcing copyright, since it would be very costly for copyright owners to sue every person who is engaged in file sharing.

The general approach is not limited to copyright law. For example, someone who sells burglar tools to a burglar is guilty of aiding and abetting if the burglar uses the tools to commit a burglary. And someone who induces a breach of contract is liable to the victim of the breach, even though the victim could just have sued the other party to the contract for breach of contract.

But difficulties arise when a product has both lawful and unlawful uses. It would be ridiculous to hold sellers of butcher knives liable civilly or criminally if a purchaser used the knife to commit a murder, unless the seller knew that that was the intended use. And even when the seller knows that the use will be illegal, he may not be liable. A standard example is the dress shop that sells a dress to a woman whom the shop knows to be a prostitute planning to wear the dress in soliciting customers. The idea is that at least in the case of minor crimes, we don't want to put sellers at risk of civil or criminal liability for aiding and abetting because it would make them too careful about inquiring into the uses of their wares; the added transaction costs would exceed the benefits in reduced social costs of crime.

In the case of Grokster and other companies that offer file-sharing services (or, in Grokster's case, just software, for unlike earlier file-sharing facilitators, such as Napster, Grokster does not copy files onto its own servers or use its servers to facilitate file sharing--it merely provides the software that enables computer owners to establish a network among themselves for sharing), there are potential lawful uses. This possibility was enough to convince the lower courts that Grokster was not a contributory infringer. Not all musical recordings or films are copyrighted (the copyrights might have expired); and in addition some producers of copyrighted works, especially if the producers are new and trying to establish a reputation (a new rock and roll band, for example), may want their works distributed as rapidly and as far as possible even at the sacrifice of royalties. In effect, these producers are willing to grant royalty-free licenses to the users of Grokster software.

Nevertheless, the Court cited evidence indicating that most of the file sharing enabled by Grokster's software is, as Grokster well knew, infringing, just as most sales of burglar tools are to burglars, though some are to people who want to be able to break into their own house if they lock themselves out and others are to the police, or to the curious, or to would-be burglars who get cold feet before they commit their first burglary with the new tools. Contributory infringement would be an empty box if any lawful uses, however trivial in relation to the unlawful, enabled the contributory infringer to get off the hook on all uses of his product even though he knew that the vast majority were infringing.

But that is not the end of the analysis. Some infringements, paradoxically, may actually benefit a copyright holder yet he may refuse to grant a royalty-free license because he thinks he can extract a royalty and thus have his cake and eat it too. People will pay more for a CD if they think they can share it with others over a peer-to-peer network, because then the CD becomes a form of currency for arranging advantageous swaps and even "buying" new friends. Then too, if you travel a lot and bring your computer with you, with file sharing you don't have to drag your favorite CDs along; file sharing in such a situation merely gives you better access to a product that you paid for--and you will pay more, if you have that better access, just as you would pay more for a cellphone that you could use in any country in the world. In addition, through file sharing you might develop a taste for a particular band or composer whose recordings you wouldn't have bought without the free exposure to them; this is file sharing as advertising of copyrighted recordings that is free to the copyright owner. 

But again, the mere possibility that infringement may confer benefits on copyright owners can't suffice to defeat a suit for contributory infringement any more than it could defeat a suit for direct infringement, as it is always possible to conjure up such possibilities. If the Grokster case is tried, the trial will provide an opportunity to compare the revenue loss to the copyright owners against the possible gains that I have listed. Unfortunately, subjecting providers of file-sharing software to the threat of trial places them at substantial risk, which may drive many of them from the market.

The final argument against imposing liability on Grokster and similar enterprises without bothering with a trial is a kind of "infant industry" argument. The software industry is dynamic and there is concern that imposing liability on software producers may retard innovation, since even if the only or major current use of some type of software is to facilitate copyright infringement, the software may turn out to have important lawful uses if only it isn't strangled in the cradle. This is hard to credit in the case of file-sharing services and software, however, since there is an immense lawful demand. File sharing of noncopyrighted materials is fundamental to the Internet, and for that matter to the intelligence system--the Intelligence Reform Act passed last fall ordains the creation of an "Information Sharing Environment" to facilitate the sharing of data across the many databases used by federal intelligence agencies. Also, any diminished innovation due to contributory-infringement liability must be traded off against the enhanced innovation that can be expected if intellectual-property rights are strongly protected by the law.

Grokster relied heavily on a case that the Supreme Court had decided many years ago involving Betamax, a predecessor to the VCR. At the time, the principal use of Betamax was to record television programs for later viewing. Insofar as the recording merely shifted the program to a more convenient viewing time, it clearly benefited the owners of the copyrights on the programs; but insofar as it enabled the viewer to erase the commercials, it hurt the copyright owners, whose remuneration depended on advertising revenues. The Supreme Court held that, given this dual-use situation, Sony, the manufacturer of the Betamax, was not a contributory infringer. The decision turned out to be fortunate for the film industry, because within a few years the sale and rental of home video recordings became a major channel of film distribution, which the studios had not anticipated. And so it is argued that file sharing of copyrighted music and film may also turn out to have unexpected benefits for the copyright owners themselves (beyond the modest benefits suggested earlier). But the logic of this argument is that there can never be liability for contributory infringement because the possibility can never be excluded that the product or service offered by the alleged contributory infringer, even if it is used exclusively by infringers, will turn out in the future to have substantial noninfringing uses.

There is a possible middle way that should be considered, and that is to provide a safe harbor to potential contributory infringers who take all reasonable (cost-justified) measures to prevent the use of their product or service by infringers. The measures might be joint with the copyright owners. For example, copyright owners who wanted to be able to sue for contributory infringement might be required, as a condition of being permitted to sue, to place a nonremovable electronic tag on their CDs that a computer would read, identifying the CD or a file downloaded from it as containing copyrighted material. Software producers would be excused from liability for contributory infringement if they designed their software to prevent the copying of a tagged file. This seems a preferable approach to using the judicial system to make a case by case assessment of whether to impose liability for contributory infringement on Grokster-like enterprises.

"There is a possible middle way that should be considered, and that is to provide a safe harbor to potential contributory infringers who take all reasonable (cost-justified) measures to prevent the use of their product or service by infringers."

Did Sony do this in the Betamax case?  No.  Does TIVO do this today?  No.  In fact, doesn't TIVO SPECIFICALLY promote infringement with their commercial skip feature?  The difference in the Court's opinion lies mostly in their unfamiliarity and lack of identification with technology in question than in any substantive difference with the Betamax case.

"Software producers would be excused from liability for contributory infringement if they designed their software to prevent the copying of a tagged file."

If software is designed according to basic software engineering principles, it should be easy for anyone with access to the source code to add or remove support for various types of data filtering, including recognition of copy-protection flags, without otherwise affecting the functionality of the software.

What would become of software producers who make the source code of their products available to their users?  Would they be simply ineligible for safe harbor under this hypothetical measure?  If not, would they have any responsibilities in terms of not making it too easy to remove the copy-protection code?  Would a HOW-TO document constitute crossing the line?  How about a compile-time flag?

"Software producers would be excused from liability for contributory infringement if they designed their software to prevent the copying of a tagged file."

While not being able to produce a mathematical proof of it, I strongly believe there is no such DRM system that cannot be broken at a cost comparable to that of a conventional media-reader device (e.g.: a CD reader).

And, while I mean neither to be too blunt, nor to digress, I think that the Grokster issue is moot from a legal point of view. The law is shaped by the long-term interests of those who wield the most significant influence in a state. Since there are so many people who make the --perhaps irresponsible-- choice of pirating today at the whatever future cost, there is little long-term support for serious legislation in the direction of limiting piracy.

The music and movie industries should probably move in two directions: lowering the costs under those of the pirate content (i.e.: below market price of conventional media) and adding hard-to-reproduce value, such as nicer packaging, better post-purchase services etc.

The only way the law can strike a balance between conflicting interests on this matter is to prescribe de collection of a blanket tax, like that for the UK public TV-station. But then again, who pays for public television? It would be a purely cosmetic solution.

People will always try to defeat any copy protection scheme, but being hacked should not also expose a company to copyright liability, so what is a good faith protection effort? That is the kind of thing courts decide every day, and is what they are for.

The existance of determined file-sharers (who popularized de-centralized peer networks like Gnutella in response to legal attacks on Napster's central repository model) is strong evidence of an under-represented popular interest in free access. A crackdown on current systems will likely cause them to morph and re-appear offshore, forcing another round of litigation.

 When television was first invented, Movie studios bemoaned the loss of revenues at theatres. They eventually responded by spending to make movies more of an experience. Technicolor was invented, wide-screen formats like Cinemascope and Cinerama were born, movie budgets were increased, etc... etc...

 Why protect the rights of non-innovative status quo players in an industry at the expense of innovation in technology. If digital file-sharing increases ease of access to information and entertainment, then perhaps it is a greater good than George Lucas' profit margin. Perhaps it is appropriate and good that innovation should pressure adjacent industries into responsive innovations or shake them from slumber.

 People who worry about payments to artists would do well to consider two things, 1. the percentage of each dollar spent that actually reaches the struggling artist, and 2. the quality of the supposed "art" that is being produced under the current mega-studio dominated system. There are many people who think that the music and film industries are sorely in need of reform in terms of both equity and quality.

 Has the American-Idol hit machine produced better songs than the wandering folk artists playing tunes for weed and world peace in the 70's? If an industry is not producing art that could be deemed worthy of patronage absent artifical regulatory props, then people supporting copyright aren't really supporting art, they are supporting vested property rights in the exploitation of commodified "art".

The middle way is the solution I have favored ever since the Metallica/Napster litigation. Every .mp3 file has a field in its id3 tag for identifying whether it is copyrighted. It would be easy for peer-to-peer networks to scan this field and omit any files identifying themselves as copyrighted from the sharing space. True, that would not prevent people who rip recordings to .mp3 format from lying about whether they are copyrighted. But it would allow makers of peer-to-peer software to say that they anticipated the risk the software could be used for infringing purposes and took precautions designed to decrease that risk.

On the heels of the discussion about eminent domain, one wonders whether California would be justified in exercising eminent domain over copyrighted works if it resulted in larger state tax revenues.  Given that the annual revenue of the consumer electronics industry, driven in part by legally-questionable sharing and watching of copyrighted content, dwarfs the annual revenue of the music and film industry, it is possible that an electronics industry driven by legal sharing and watching of content would more than compensate for any lost tax revenue from the content industry itself.

"Anything placed in the public domain becomes fair game." This case is just another case of corporate profit hunting based on the "Deep Pockets Theory". Instead of going after the actual actor, the industry is going after the facilitator with the money. 

Perhaps, if the industry took better care of its products through security (such as encryption) there wouldn't be this problem. The solution may lie in encrypting the products, then selling a product that allows the user to translate the product into a usable form. This way the Industry gets its royalties irregardless of the source. The problem then becomes have we created an "encryption arms race"? 

Ahh..., the joys of human ingenuity and the desire to get something for nothing.

I'd concur with Corey, on Posner's cost-benefit "middle way" approach being an obviously good one for the judiciary due to their experience in balancing costs, benefits, rights, etc. (taken roughly, I presume, from Posner's opinion in the Aimster case a few years back, which had similar reasoning and was the most cogent of the "file sharing cases" decided in that period).  Reasonable steps in public and clearly cost-effectively proveable to a court would establish that Grokster and Co. were not interested in copyright infringement in any way, and had a genuine business model to pursue.  Of course, the upshot of this is that Congress could have inserted this provision into Title 17 years ago and given some basis for the Court to reach the "middle way" -- but alas, Congress cannot move much, especially when it really needs to these days.

Interestingly, this is what the new SnoCap software development kit (SDK) purports to do, by allowing P2P companies to "legitimize" their networks by adding a package to their software that can sort through and identify songs that are copyrighted and songs that are not.  I do wonder how successful they will be, but their system would fix a lot of these problems without keeping out noninfringing uses of P2P -- thus spoiling the argument that we'd be clamping down on innovation.

This "cost effective" nonsense is inapposite when applied to much of P2P software (MIRC, bit torrent, etc) which is made by individuals, not corporations, and without a mindset on profit.

Moreover, VA Law, you ignore the unequal impact of instituting such policies.  It is the individual programmer and start-up companies which will be disproportionately effected because they are unlikely to easily absorb the additional litigation and development costs.  If one can be sued for providing free-of-charge P2P software, then one simply won't bother.  This sort of policy is anti-competitive and anti-innovation.

<span style="color:#999">Posted by: Palooka | 07/07/2005 at 01:20 PM</span>

Palooka - I happen to agree with you with respect to individuals who program P2P software, that the "'cost effective' nonsense" as you put it doesn't apply in the SAME way.  However, we're considering the more narrow case of software companies that make money by advertising (if I recall) over the P2P software.  As for a start-up company that can easily attempt some filtering software tied to an SDK or otherwise (such as SnoCap) that would prevent illegal trading but permit legal trading, then that is a reasonable thing for the law to force.

I don't worry about being anti-innovation under this test because programmers who like the idea will still try to create P2P software that will trade noninfringing software, text, music, movies, etc. but that complies with the "reasonable steps" test.  Remember that the "innovation" benefit to society comes from the new technology's ability to share NON-infringing data between users; the infringing trade doesn't create a net benefit for society because copyright owners lose a substantial amount of protection even as consumers gain very effective access to a digital black market (which is what most P2P networks work as, let's face it).

As for the case of programs that have no identifiable author or no company managing them, I don't think they fall under this test because they have no control over the free P2P client software they distribute or interact with them (like showing ads).  We're concerned with contributory infringement, yes; but we're more concerned with companies that PROFIT from contributory infringement, especially when they don't take any steps to prevent the infringement and indirectly benefit from said high levels of infringement (via ad revenue).  We can't do much about the anonymous programmer who writes a gnutella-style network/client and distributes it -- but he's not profiting from it.

Two points:

1)  It is interesting that the court accomplished what a minority of legislators tried to with the failed "Inducement Act."  Looking at comparitive institutional analysis the court perhaps should have waited for congress to act and then rule on its Constitutionality.

2)  It would be interesting to see if the same reasoning would apply to gun manufacturers who produce and market guns with killing force, concealability, etc., e.g Mac-10's and Tec-9's.

"We're concerned with contributory infringement, yes; but we're more concerned with companies that PROFIT from contributory infringement, especially when they don't take any steps to prevent the infringement and indirectly benefit from said high levels of infringement (via ad revenue)."

Didn't Sony profit from the infringement that occurred with their Betamax machine?  Yes, they did.  VA Law, are you arguing that the Betamax case was wrongly decided or are you arguing that their is something different about Grokster?  Why what was OK for Sony is not OK for Grokster?  Sony didn't take any steps to prevent infringment with their Betamax machine (striking the fast forward function is one example of what they COULD have done).

Again, I go back to the similarity with VCR (and today DVR) technologies.  They are bought for so-called "time-shifting" but they are probably just as often bought for avoding commercials and for archiving, both of which fall outside of the "fair use" doctrine.  

"I don't worry about being anti-innovation under this test because programmers who like the idea will still try to create P2P software that will trade noninfringing software, text, music, movies, etc. but that complies with the "reasonable steps" test."

Sophistry ALERT.  OK, you're telling me that the chance of getting sued for FREE SOFTWARE is not going to drastically reduce the willingness of programmers to write these programs?  If you're going to argue it's worth the tradeoff, fine.  But don't pretend programmers are going to risk financial ruin for something they are providing for free.  

Anybody who is even remotely familiar with software knows that the most innovation comes from precisely these corners of the programming world.  But, hey, let's whore our selves to the RIAA/MPAA, even though it's not even clear if they're losing money in the first place.

Excellent point.  At first I thought it wasn't an apt analogy.  But it is!  Just as it is technologically feasible to protect copyrighted works from infringement, it is also technologically feasible for weapons to only fire for their registered owner (I think there are fingerprint scanners or something like that which accomplisht his task).

Ahhh, but the solution must be "cost effective."  I'd like to hear the argument--I know it's out there somewhere--that the as of yet undetermined losses of the entertainment industry are more of a priority than the tens of thousands who die from firearms in this country every year.

This sort of policy is more of a slipperly slope than many realize, I am afraid.

The issue is "contributory infringement" which applies to only copyright and perhaps trademark. The gun analogy lies outside of this limitation. 

Besides, as the NRA has continually pointed out; "guns don't kill people, people kill people". So once again we're back to the importance of the "bad actor" and their actions. Unless of course we want to change the basis of Law and include any and all facilitators. "Hey! you're resposible and liable because you didn't do anything about it!"  That's right, "Hang em all and let God sort em out." Judge Bean would've loved that. It's really all about good causal analysis, legal principle, and public policy.

"Unless of course we want to change the basis of Law and include any and all facilitators."

 Nah, because we already have this nice thing called Product Liability, which is useful to force manufacturers of dangerous products to internalize the costs of accidents or diseases they cause. And guns cause lots of unintended accidents and death, no matter what the catchy NRA slogans say.

 Asbestos doesn't kill people! Breathing asbestos kills people!

 But I agree, its got nothing to do with copyright infringement.

You've probably read Tim Wu's "Miss Manners' School of Jurisprudence" on Slate: http://slate.msn.com/id/2121410/entry/2121673/

There are no tech solutions to copyright that can't be overcome. The only legal question, apparently, is did the programmer at least make an honest attempt? If you try to explain to a "pre-computer age" judge that it's futile and a waste of energy to even try, then you lose because you aren't being nice.

I support the music industry's campaign to sue individual infringers. They are stealing music, no question about it. But going after programmers gets us into this weird legal swamp where justice depends on a judge's mood that day. We need clear rules or no rules, but not arbitrary decisions.

"I support the music industry's campaign to sue individual infringers."

 There is a solution that worked well in the drug war... NOT. What should we do, put them in prison? Bankrupt them and ruin their lives?
Sue a college student and an award of attorney fees alone will do that. So everyone settles for a predefined fine, and now you've got a business interest using the civil courts to write a defacto criminal misdemeanor statute. I thought most people were against legislation by the judiciary?

 With so many people downloading files, it is possible that there is no majority for the proposition that "stealing" RIAA members profits is wrong. Certainly there are many who, even if they are against copying, are also against public beatings of randomly selected kids. If there is no majority norm against copyright infringement, then you can't sue enough people to create one, and you can't create one through vengeance either.

"The gun analogy lies outside of this limitation."

No, it doesn't.  Since when is property more important than life?  I love it when people propose a legal rule and then pretend that the principle cannot be applied in different contexts.  I think they're confusing the judiciary for the legislature.   Now, if the legislature adopted the "middle way" Judge Posner proposed, then of course it would be a different situation.  I thought what was under discussion was a judicially imposed "middle way."  And in that case, I see no reason to limit the middle way to copyrights  Why?  What good reason is there to differentiate between copyright infringement and murder (or the tort of wronful death or whatever).

"I support the music industry's campaign to sue individual infringers. They are stealing music, no question about it."

Is reading Shakespear "stealing" Shakespear?  At what point does "stealing" become OK?  And does the current copyright term of life+70 years have any economic justification?  Who's "stealing" from whom?

Moreover, as Becker addresses, it is unclear whether p2p copyright infringement actually hurts the entertainment industry.  How you could call something which is potentially neutral or positive to the industry "stealing" is beyond me.  At best, it is an open question.

The concept of contributory infringement aims to minimize the enforcement costs borne by victims (copyright owners) by targeting third parties (facilitators of infringement) not explicitly defined in the law.

It suffers from two grave faults:

Firstly, it fails to consider the obvious solution, shifting all (or most) costs to the wrongdoers defined in the law, copyright infringers. If the plaintiff may as a matter of course recover reasonable attorney's fees, after winning in court and proving that he attempted to arrange a settlement out of court, in most cases the full cost will indeed be borne by infringers, no matter if a dozen or a thousand have to be sued. This is not to say I support a law that could be used to bankrupt poor file-sharing students - maybe it should be curtailed, e.g. limiting per person liability  - but most definitely it should not be used to bankrupt companies not explicitly defined as wrongdoers by the law.

This leads to the second point, the failure to consider the long-term dangers inherent in allowing courts to target third parties, which thus gives the courts the de facto control over the meaning of the law. It weakens the power of the legislature and concentrates it in the hands of judges using a loose interpretation of the law. "Loose interpretation" of statutes is a travesty: it means that unelected and largely non-removable officials gain control at the expense of elected and revocable ones (juries are not much help here either). This is a case of lengthening of feedback loops between the state and the citizenry, since the public has a much more tenuous hold over the behavior of courts than over legislative bodies ,as imperfect as they are. Thus judicial activism becomes the order of the day, leading to outrages that cannot be easily reversed in the next election.

Taken together, the above considerations imply there is no economic justification to contributory infringement in copyright law, and the long-term effects of using this doctrine may be pernicious, leading to inefficiencies in the functioning of the political system.

Let's cut to the heart of the matter. Do we want it to be cheap and easy to copy stuff? I think the answer is clearly yes. So what sense does it make for courts to punish people for making a better copier?

Posner seems to start from the premise that we must apply the theory of contributory infringement to something (otherwise it would be useless! And we can't have a useless legal theory, can we?) A better starting point would be to question whether the concept of contributory infringement has any practical application.

I rather agree with Dan's comment.  It would be one thing if Grokster et al. had been sued for Conspiracy to commit infringement, or even RICO with infringement predicates.

Then there would be familiar principles of scienter and causation on which the analysis could latch.

The concept of "contributory infringement" seems to me like a way of importing concepts of accomplice and facilitation liability into Copyright law, while jettisoning the limitations imposed on such concepts by centuries of experience with the common law.  This seems to, as it did the 9th Circuit and, I think, the Supreme Court, leave adjudicators and potential innovators fundamentally adrift, without guidance or any ability to verify the legality of contemplated actions to a reasonable degree of certainty, as well as abandoning any semblance of balance for the needs of the inventors of new technology.

At the end of the day, there are two and only two differences between Grokster and vendors of blank audio cassette tapes:

Grokster is a vastly more powerful tool for the advancement of free speech rights and the avoidance of government, or private, censorship.

And the cassette tape vendors pretended they didn't know what the tapes were being used for.

It is hard to imagine that there is any commercial profit that is worth more than the freedom to trasmit information.  The recording industry will have to find its own business model to adapt to this new world.  Artists will continue to create.  This may have a negative imact on one group:  Big Budget Entertainment.  Potential profits for the wealthiest entertainers will decrease first.  The smaller players will have as much face time as expensive advertisements become less useful.  The entertainment world may end up producing higher quality content after all.  The gains that the entertainment industry realizes from the increased rate of communication on the internet has to also be considered - there is more exposure than ever possible through multiple chanels.  Trying to stop file sharing is analogous to preventing photocopying -  the difference is the ease and rate of transmission.

While I would agree that it is better to require copyright owners to use technological measures to protect their content, the sad fact is that technological protection is always ineffective, by the nature of the product. If one can listen to a recording one can copy it. In the case of digital material, once the genie of copying, or of a copy, is out of the bottle it cannot be put back.
Instead, I would posit that it is preferable to eliminate contributory infringement, and place the onus on copyright owners to solve the problem of inducing compliance in consumers, such as effective post-facto micropayment and mass-licensing systems.
