### Comments

---

Here is a paper by Jason Furman attacking the Bush formulation of the HSA notion. Love to get your comments on it.

I generally favor the consumer-directed health care approach but I have a question about chronic disease and nursing home care, both of which have significant, long-term costs. It seems to fall between the cracks between "regular" health care expenses which fit the HSA approach well, and catastrophic expenses, which also fit.

Thanks.
