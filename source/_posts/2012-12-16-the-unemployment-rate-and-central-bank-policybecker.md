On December 12th, Ben Bernanke, the chairman of the Fed,
indicated that the Fed would pursue what one might think is simply a variant of
the full employment target by keeping nominal interest rates close to zero
until the US unemployment rate dips below 6.5%-it is currently 7.7%- or until
inflation is forecast to exceed 2.5%. The challenge facing this proposal is that
while an unemployment rate target may seem to be just the flip side of the full
employment target, unemployment can be nudged by other government policies in
ways that have little effect on employment.

The present high level of unemployment in the US in good
measure reflects the slow rate of recovery of real GDP and employment from its
recession levels. According to "Okun’s Law”, the recovery in employment from a
recession is simply related to the recovery in real GDP (see the discussion of
Okun’s Law in my blog post on 11/4/2012). Okun’s Law implies that a central
bank can use the recovery in real GDP as a proxy for the recovery in employment
toward a full employment goal.

If the change in the unemployment rate were simply the
mirror image of the change in the employment rate, ”low” unemployment would be
as good a target as full employment. That would imply that Okun’s Law could be
stated as a relation between the decline in unemployment from recession levels
and the recovery in real GDP from recession levels. Then the recovery in
unemployment to its “full employment” level could meet the Fed’s goal of
maintaining full employment (along with controlling inflation), as in Bernanke’s
recent announced goal of no more than 6.5% unemployment.

The complication is that changes in unemployment rates
during business cycles are not just mirror images of changes in employment rates.
This has been especially the case during the Great Recession. By definition, the
unemployed equals the difference between the number of persons in the labor
force and the number of persons working. The unemployment rate is then defined
as the number of individuals who are unemployed as a fraction of the labor
force. It follows from the definition of unemployment that the unemployment
rate equals one minus the employment rate (the ratio of the number of persons
employed to the number of persons in the labor force). This relation shows that
changes in the unemployment rate would be equal to but opposite in sign to
changes in the employment rate only as long as the labor force remained fixed.

During business cycles, the employment rate and the
unemployment rate do move in opposite directions, but the relation is far from
one to one, especially during severe recessions. The reason is that the labor
force also changes over the course of a business cycle. Especially during
severe recessions, some workers get discouraged about finding jobs and leave
the labor force. This would tend artificially to reduce the unemployment rate
even when both employment and unemployment did not change. This is why the official
unemployment rate is usually supplemented with measures of the “total”
unemployment rate that include both individuals who got discouraged and
withdraw from the labor force, as well as those working part time because they
could not find full time jobs. This total unemployment rate now stands at 14.4%,
much above the 7.7% official rate.

The official unemployment rate is also affected by public policies
that encourage individuals to either leave the labor force or work only part
time. These are partly policies that increase eligibility for means tested
welfare programs, such as food stamps, subsidies on mortgage payments, and
Medicaid benefits. These and other means-tested programs greatly expanded
during the past four years (for a good discussion of the evidence on this, see
Casey Mulligan’s recent book “The Redistribution Recession: How Labor Market
Distortions Contracted the Economy”).

The unemployment rate is also affected by policies that
affect eligibility for unemployment compensation, such as the extension of
unemployment benefits during this recession to 99 weeks. Such an extension
increases unemployment because it encourages individuals to become or remain
unemployed in order to collect unemployment benefits for a longer time. The net
effect of extensions in unemployment benefits is to increase the unemployment
rate differently from any decline in the employment rate.

This discussion implies that a shift by the Fed from a full
employment target to an unemployment target could lead to some shift in the
Fed’s goals. In addition, and most important, some of the causes of changes in
the unemployment rate are not amenable to manipulation by the Fed through very low
interest rates and the purchase of bonds or other assets. Unemployment rates
will remain higher than in the past, regardless of Fed policies, as long as the
extensions of various means-tested programs and of unemployment benefits during
the past few years remain in effect.

A major risk of trying to implement an unemployment target
through present Fed policies is that the inflation rate could increase in a
futile attempt to bring down further the unemployment rate to a targeted rate,
as happened in the 1970s. To its credit, the Fed protected against this
possibility by setting its target at a relatively high unemployment rate of
6.5%, even though the rate prior to the onset of the recession in 2007 was well
under 5%. The Fed also directly faced the risk of creating excessive inflation
by setting its target as no more than 6.5% unemployment only as long as the
inflation rate does not rise about 2.5%, a modest rate of inflation.

I'm not so sure that the solution to the "Jobless Recovery" of the last four years of the "Great Recession/Depression", lies in our use of sophisticated analyses of formulas, graphs, charts and the manipulation of the money supply to affect employment rates, unemployment rates and inflation rates. It's somewhat like a city after snowstorm. You can't get the mess cleaned up and things back to normal unless you put the snowplows on the street and shovels and brooms into people's hands and set them to work. Analysing the problem doesn't solve the problem. Or trying to find excuses as to why the job can't be done or the best way too do the job. We've seem to have spent far too much time anlysing the job as opposed to doing the job, getting it done and moving on.

  Glenn Reynolds is commenting recurrently on the "Higher Ed" bubble,which he feels is a coming quake in the ed system.I have the privelege of supporting a brother who has two weak degrees and won't do blue collar work.A niece and nephew are currently taking the same course  offerings while planning for law school.Do you feel 1) There will be a glut of young people whose expectations outweigh their employability and 2) if there are measures  that can avert this problem if ti's real?

2.5% is too low. You forget the zero lower bound. There is a real risk to having the inflation rate too close to this. 3.5%-4% would be safer: avoid Scylla still, but stay away from Charybdis, which historical Fed policy does not do.
