The recent surprise resignation of Microsoft’s chief
executive, Steve Ballmer, only made official what has long been obvious;
namely, that Microsoft is in decline, and is no longer the great and dominating
company it once was. Microsoft’s rapid decline may be inevitable in industries
with rapid technological change, which should influence anti-trust policy in
the United States and other countries concerned about monopolies.

Microsoft’s Windows has been by far the dominant operating
system for personal computers during the past 3 decades, as it was installed in
some years in more than 95% of all personal computers, and is still installed in
over 90% of all computers worldwide. What economists call “network economies”
gave Windows a major advantage over Apple’s operating system and that of
potential entrants. Since computers have to communicate with each other, it has been advantageous to buy a computer with Windows when most other computers also used
Windows.

Microsoft had monopoly power as measured not only by its
dominant share of all computer operating systems, but also by the very large
profits it continues to make year after year. These profits led to an elevated
price of Microsoft’s stock- it has since fallen significantly- and to enormous
wealth not only for Bill Gates, but also for many other employees of the
company.  Microsoft attracted topnotch
employees, and was generally considered the leading company in the world.

Complaints by competitors against so-called unfair tactics
by Microsoft attracted the attention of the Department of Justices. It began an
anti trust case against Microsoft that accused the company of abusing its
monopoly power. This resulted in an expensive and bruising battle between the company
and the government, including the attorney generals of many state governments. The
final settlement did not force many changes in what Microsoft did, but the case
may have distracted Microsoft’s leaders from the goal of continuing to innovate
in the computer industry.

We will probably never know if the lawsuit damaged
Microsoft’s subsequent performance, but forces were gathering even prior to the
lawsuit that greatly undermined Microsoft’s dominance. The growth of the
Internet was a major force, and was itself sparked by major network economies. Gathering
information from, and communicating via email through, the Internet became the
primary interest of many consumers, and did not require word processing and
other tools at the heart of Windows. Microsoft’s Explorer system that provided
access to the Internet rapidly declined in importance.

Apple soon became the most important innovator in the high
tech industry, with its iphone, iPod and IPad. Smart phones and Tablets
provided easy access to the Internet, and simple communication among users
through email, texting, Facebook, and Twitter without the need to own a
computer, and certainly without having to rely on Microsoft. This company tried
to compete with its own tablets and other Internet devices, but it could never
regain the attractive products it had when first introducing Windows. Perhaps a
reluctance to “cannibalize” the market for its computer software made Microsoft
drag its feet in getting into new products that allowed direct access to the
Internet. In any case, Ballmer and other Microsoft leaders downplayed the
importance of smart phones and other such Internet devices.

Google is in turn replacing Apple as innovation leader in
the industry, with its dominance of the market for gathering information from
the Internet, its Android operating system for smart phones, its driverless car,
and Google glasses.  This process whereby
new entrants erode over time the market position of dominant companies is part
of “dynamic competition”, as opposed to the static competition discuss in
economic textbooks. The large profits made by dominant companies encourage
entry of new competitors who try to appropriate some of those profits for
themselves. These new entrants may not be able to compete effectively by
offering the same products and services as dominant firms do because these
firms benefit from network economies and other advantages of scale. Instead,
they innovate with different products that take away some of the market held by
dominant firms. Unlike Microsoft, Apple did not mind, and probably enjoyed,
cannibalizing Microsoft’s market.

Anti trust policy should recognize that dynamic competition
is often a powerful force when static competition is weak. The big policy
question then is whether it is worthwhile to bring expensive and time consuming
anti trust cases against still innovating firms that have considerable profits
and monopoly power, given the significant probability that new competitors will
before long greatly erode this power through different products? I believe the
answer to that is no, and that policy should often rely on dynamic competition,
even when that allows dominant firms only temporarily to enjoy economic power.

You ignore the damage done by the Microsoft operating system monoculture. It had no competition, so hackers made a mess of security flaws. It was cheaper to fix the flaws than to redesign the system to make security a priority, so Microsoft is the gigantic hole in the internet that lets spammers, phishers and the NSA run free. Nothing has changed that, including the illusory market system. Microsoft is losing because its main platform, the desktop computer, is losing share to smaller systems, not because it is losing its monopoly in desktop systems. The security flaws, including the day zero exploits described in the Snowden revelations, remain.

Markets don't fix things that are expensive to fix, and risky. That is just as true of the horribly flawed Microsoft operating system as it is of the lack of competition in the provision of telecommunications services and a hundred other systematically weak capital-intensive businesses. They use government and other gigantic forces to protect their interests.

As to the complexity of antitrust cases, perhaps you could ask why they are so complex and time-consuming. Could that be a systemic bias in the courts in favor of business?

A small typographical correction: "attorney generals" should read "attorneys general".
