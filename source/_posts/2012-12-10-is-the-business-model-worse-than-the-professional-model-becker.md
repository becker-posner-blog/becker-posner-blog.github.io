Medical patients and consumers of legal services may be
badly served because the doctors and lawyers treating them are either
incompetent or unethical. I believe that the low level of competence of many
doctors and lawyers is the biggest source of bad medical care and legal
representation. I will emphasize the changes in medical care since I am more
familiar with the evidence in this field.

Many studies have shown sizable differences within the
United States in the treatments provided for different forms of cancer,
cardiovascular disease, and other diseases. Sometimes, differences in
treatments are consistent with all the physicians and hospitals involved being
competent, knowledgeable, and ethical because different approaches appear to
have similar outcomes for patients. Often, however, some treatments are used
even though quantitative studies show, and leaders in medicine indicate, that
these treatments are unnecessary or decidedly inferior to best practice medical
care.

Some of these incorrect or excessive treatments are
motivated mainly by the monetary gain to doctors or hospitals, such as overuse
of MRIs, or multiple use of triage facilities for a given patient on the same
day. However, inferior or excessive treatments are often used because doctors
misdiagnose a disease or condition, or because they are just not up to date on
what are the best treatments for conditions they correctly diagnose.

The sharp growth during past several decades in the drugs
and surgeries available to treat different diseases makes it harder than in the
past for less competent doctors and hospitals to keep up with best practices.
This is why one would expect the frequency of deviations from best medical
practices to have grown over time, even when the distributions in the abilities
and ethical standards of doctors and hospitals have not changed.

Have the deviations from best medical practice grown even
faster than would be expected from the advancement in medical knowledge,
perhaps because of a decline in ethical standards of doctors and hospitals, or
the growth in medical specialization emphasized by Posner?  That is possible, although I do not
know of evidence that assesses the changes over time in the ethics of doctors.
Growth in medical specialization per se should reduce the degree of bad medical
practice because specialists are more knowledgeable of advances in their field
than are general practitioners. Specialization has increased over time mainly
because of the growth in medical knowledge and the increased size of the
medical market. This is why specialization has grown in all modern countries
with very different ways of organizing the medical field, although its growth
has been more extensive in the United States.

I will spend much less time on the legal profession because
Posner has covered changes there very well. Lawyers involved in corporate or
class action practices frequently earn a lot. That is not surprising since even
slightly more competent lawyers can often make a large difference in the
monetary gains from IPOs, mergers and acquisitions, and product liability
suits.

Has the greater competition for lawyers by different law
firms, the increased turnover of lawyers from the larger law firms, and other
changes in the organization of the legal profession led to lower ethical
standards by lawyers, or to a greater social waste of resources spent on lawyers? Any adversary system has “waste” in the sense that
lawyers on one side of a dispute partly just offset the arguments put forward
by lawyers on the other side. Perhaps that “waste” has grown over time as the
stakes in corporate disputes have gotten bigger, and perhaps the adversary
system is inferior to other types of approaches to resolution of legal
disputes.

However, none of this implies that much of any growth in
“waste” from legal disputes is due to the increased competition or greater
turnover in the legal field.

As for the "waste" inherent in adversarial systems, the best legal advice is, "Mitigate don't Litigate". There are plenty of courses in "Conflict" Resolution that teach principles to avoid the use of Litigation and the Courts whenever possible. Only a poor Lawyer would take a case to Court when other approaches are available...
