Government programs, such as social security or price
support of agriculture, are extremely difficult to cut back once they have been
established. Yet, at times, specific programs have been reduced and even
eliminated.  It is clear why programs
tend to keep going, but it is also possible to understand why they sometimes do
get reformed, reduced, and even eliminated.

Millions of potential government programs are conceivable,
but they fail to gain political traction because they do not have enough
political support. However, once a government program has been running for a
while, politically powerful vested interests develop that seek to maintain and
even expand its scope. That vested interests may develop to support the
continuation of programs is obvious since every government program favors some particular
set of individuals or companies. For example, social security and Medicare
favor the elderly, while an ethanol program that subsidizes the use of corn in
creating fuel for cars clearly helps farmers who grow corn.

The groups favored by a program sometimes form advocacy
groups to further promote their interests. Astute politicians may realize they
can gain votes and campaign contributions by becoming advocates of programs
that help individuals, unions, and companies in their districts. One way or
another, powerful political support usually develops for government subsidies
and other programs.

One might expect political forces regarding particular
programs to be balanced because they not only favor certain groups, but they
also harm others. For example, an ethanol subsidy program harms the purchasers
of corn and of meat. Social security retirement incomes require taxes on
younger workers to help pay for these incomes.

However, political forces are not typically equally
aligned because of a basic political asymmetry: the gains from a government
program are usually far more concentrated than the costs. For example, an
increase in social security retirement incomes by 10% has a sizeable effect on
retirees, but a much smaller effect on each worker who is taxed a little more
to pay for these added benefits. A program of accelerated depreciation on
capital investments might help capital-intensive businesses a lot, but has a
relatively small effect on each taxpayer who has to make up the lost revenue due
to reduced income from taxes on business profits.

This basic asymmetry in the alignment of political forces
has been understood for a long time. The 19th century American
astronomer and economist, Simon Newcomb, said in 1885, “One cent per
year out of each inhabitant would make an annual income of $500,000. By
expending a fraction of {their} profit, the proposers of policy A could make
the country respond with appeals in their favor…Thus year after year every man
in public life would hear what would seem to be the unanimous voice of public
opinion on the side opposed to the public interests”(Principles of Political
Economy).

Yet despite this fundamental political asymmetry, some
programs have been reduced in scope and even eliminated. In particular, the
ethanol subsidy program in the US has been cut back, and various European
countries, such as Italy and Greece, have extended the age before government
employees become eligible for their generous retirement pensions.

If the political asymmetry approach is our guide to
understanding the durability of government programs, then presumably programs
that get into trouble have had a shift in political support away from
beneficiaries and in favor of those harmed. Obvious examples of this include the
aging of the population in developed countries that has raised the burden of
social security programs by increasing the number of beneficiaries and reducing
the number of workers to tax. Airline regulation got into trouble because the
growth in air travel increased the number of travelers harmed by regulations
that maintained high ticket prices and kept out entry of new types of airlines
offering more basic service, such as Southwest and JetBlue.

Shifts in the alignment of political forces apply to total
government spending as well as to individual programs. For example, the
financial crisis created serious problems for overall spending in a country
like Greece because it raised the burden of the large government (and private)
debt contracted during the good times leading up to the crisis. Pressure to
rein in entitlement spending on medical care and retirement incomes have grown
because these programs require more and more funding from a relatively smaller
tax base of working persons.

Clearly, the alignment of political forces are more likely
to shift regarding a relatively small program, such as support of rice
production, than on the overall level of government spending. This is
especially the case in an environment of robust economic growth that makes it
easier to fund the overall government budget. But with slow economic growth, a
changing age distribution toward older persons, and other structural changes in
a society, even the overall level of spending faces stronger political
opposition.

One problem with cutting government programs is that it seems like an abstraction and really not tangible to me and the regular joe.  Most people would say yeah that sounds good but we don't really understand it or can readily measure.  My wife who is in stem used to always hear about cutbacks in the space program, but it didn't seem to majorly affect her.  Yeah you could see small things but it wasn't like you could calculate it or see it or even kow whether it was just because the project was poorly managed

   Many countries have cut back substantially on government ownership of businesses--- and not just the Communist ones. That is evidence that governments can shrink.
