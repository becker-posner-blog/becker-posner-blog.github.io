The federal tax code is a mess from any economic perspective.
It is not efficient, fair, or clear. A complete set of suggestions to improve
the tax system would take hundreds of pages, as did the excellent 2005 Report
of the Presidentâ€™s Advisory Panel on Federal Tax Reform. My discussion will
concentrate on a few of the needed changes that would help stimulate a more
efficient and faster growing American economy.

A major priority is to eliminate taxes on savings and
investments. One reason is that they involve double taxation since personal and
corporate incomes are first taxed, and then the returns on the savings and
investment out of these incomes are taxed again later on. A second even more
important problem with taxes on savings and investments is that in the long run
they are shifted to labor because these taxes lower after-tax returns, and
thereby discourage investments. A lower rate of investment slows down capital
accumulation, which leads to a lower ratio of capital to labor. Wages are lower
and pretax returns to capital are higher when the capital/labor ratio is lower.

Moreover, the present system taxes different forms of saving
and different types of investment goods at different rates. This distorts the
allocation of investments among investment categories. For example,
depreciation tax rules allow durable capital to be depreciated more slowly than
less durable capital, which lowers the relative tax rate on more durable
capital. Similarly, savings that enter tax-free IRA or Roth accounts are taxed
less heavily than other forms of savings.

One way completely to eliminate taxation of investments is
to allow all investments to be written off immediately as expenses instead of being
depreciated over time. Taxing only earnings would eliminate double taxation of
savings.

Expensing investments and taxing earnings moves the income
tax code a long way in the direction of a tax on consumption rather than on
incomes. The basic efficiency advantage of consumption taxes is that they do
not distort the decision to consume now rather than consume later since the
returns on savings and investments are not taxed. By contrast, income taxes do
distort this decision since they tax the incomes earned on savings as well as
the incomes that led to the savings.

Whether ones moves to a consumption tax or not, taxes should
be simpler and flatter because that would reduce the large cost of tax
compliance, and encourage greater investment and work effort. A reasonable proposal
that would maintain progressivity yet have a much flatter tax structure would
be to have only two or three tax rates, such as 20%, 25%, and 30%. The 20% rate
would apply to incomes below a certain threshold, 25% would be the rate on
incomes above this lower threshold until an upper income threshold, and 30%
would be the tax rate on all incomes above the higher threshold. The tax rate
on low labor market earnings would be even less than 20% if the earned income
tax credit on low earnings were retained. This credit encourages poorer
individuals to enter the labor force rather than staying out to become eligible
for various welfare benefits, such as food stamps, unemployment compensation,
and housing subsidies.

The income tax base should be widened both because that
would be more efficient, and because a wider base would also help maintain tax
revenue as rates are flattened, and taxes on savings and investments are removed.
For starters, the deductibility of mortgage interest should be eliminated
because that artificially encourages investments in home ownership relative to
investments in other forms of capital. This deduction also favors higher income
families since they are more likely to itemize deductions, and they have higher
marginal tax rates. If it were too difficult politically to eliminate this
deduction, a big improvement would be to allow a tax credit to all homeowners
equal to a fraction of their mortgage interest payments. There would be an
upper bound to the amount of interest payments that could qualify for the tax credit.

The exclusion of interest on state and local bonds from
income taxes should be abolished because that artificially encourages spending
by these governments relative to spending by households and businesses. Since
higher income individuals hold the vast majority of state and local bonds, this
tax exemption also favors higher income persons in an undesirable way.

The tax on business cash flow (net of investment outlays)
should be aligned with the proposed flatter personal income tax structure by
lowering corporate and partnership tax rates to the proposed maximum tax rate
on personal income, say 30%. Doing this, and taxing business cash flow net of
investment deductions, would integrate the business tax into an overall consumption
tax.

I discussed the most needed reforms, although other reforms
are also desirable-many are considered in the report mentioned above on federal
tax reform. Unfortunately, major reforms do not have much chance of enactment
in the present political climate, but they are longer run goals that should
appeal to both Democrats and Republicans.

Good suggestions.  I would go further and eliminate all deductions.  Or better yet, to avoid the double taxation issue, eliminate taxation of income altogether and keep only taxation of capital gains.  I'd prefer taxing spending to taxing saving, but that would seem to conflict with the policy of promoting spending and discouraging savings.  In any event, there's plenty to fix in the current system.

From above: "For example, depreciation tax rules allow durable capital to be depreciated more slowly than less durable capital, which lowers the relative tax rate on more durable capital." 

This seems backwards. Quicker depreciation gives the taxpayer the money sooner. Isn't my relative tax rate lower if I can put some money in the bank earlier?

And it also seems too simple. If depreciation were exactly accurate, 10 years for an asset that lasts 10 years and 2 years for an asset that lasts 2 years, would there be any tax incentive for investing in one asset over the other? The rate for each asset would reflect true depreciation of the asset, and the income generated by the asset would be exactly measured, so it would seem that the tax code would create no distortion of which asset to buy.

P.S. Wouldn't expensing all capital investments distort investment in favor of long-term capital? If all capital investment were expensed, I'd rather buy one $2000 machine in 2010 that lasts two years than one $1000 machine in 2010 that lasts one year and another $1000 machine in 2011 that lasts the next year. The price would be the same and the work done would be the same, but the longer term asset would give a $1000 deduction one year sooner.
