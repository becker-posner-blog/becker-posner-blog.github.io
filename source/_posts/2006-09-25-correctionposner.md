Unforgivably, I referred to DDT as a "herbicide." It is, of course, a pesticide. A herbicide is used to destroy weeds and other plants.

I think your error highlights the problems when people, (even the brightest), speak outside their areas of expertise.  What is obvious to lay-people is, upon examination, clouded by hidden realities and socio-political mythology.

Regardless of your gaffe, I think most people will be able to forgive one of the greatest economist/judges ever. (Note: it's not sucking up if it's anonymous.)

From Posner these melting lines to lift the human spirit:

"Not that eliminating childhood deaths from malaria (I have seen an estimate that 80 percent of malaria deaths are of children) would be a completely unalloyed boon for Africa, which suffers from overpopulation. But on balance the case for eradicating malaria in Africa, as for eradicating AIDS (an even bigger killer) in Africa, is compelling. Malaria is a chronic, debilitating disease afflicting many more people than die of it, and the consequence is a significant reduction in economic productivity."

Glad to see you are on to the more important subjects.  Care to update your cost/benefit analysis of the War ON Iraq? http://www.guardian.co.uk/Iraq/Story/0,2763,1681119,00.html
