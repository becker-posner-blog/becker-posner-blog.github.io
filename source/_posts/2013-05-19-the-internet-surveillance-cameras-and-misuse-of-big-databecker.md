Surveillance cameras, tax reporting, Internet-based data,
emails, mobile phone records and their cameras are some of the more salient modern
ways that provide information on individuals and organizations. Few object when
banks and other organizations use surveillance cameras on their premises to
deter theft and robbery. There is much greater concern when Internet companies
like Google and Facebook use their vast stores of data to learn about the interests
and other personal information, of the millions of individuals who use their
services. Probably, however, the most serious threat is the misuse of “big data”
by governments, including democratic governments.

This past week the possible misuse of extensive data by the
Internal Revenue Service and the Justice Department has been widely reported. Prior
to the presidential election in 2012, tax inspectors may have singled out for
closer scrutiny the applications of “Tea Party” and other conservative organizations
for tax-exempt status. The Justice Department secured telephone records of
reporters for the Associated Press in order to find their sources for leaked
information. Data mining with advanced technologies played a part in both alleged
abuses of governmental power.

To be sure, using the vast data resources of modern
governments to target opponents is not new. For example, Richard Nixon wanted
tax inspectors to audit his list of “enemies” and avoid auditing his friends,
but George Shultz, the then Secretary of Treasury, refused to go along. What is
different now is the explosive growth in governmental (and private) access to
“big data” with extensive information on millions of individuals and hundreds
of thousands of organizations.

Of course, big data has many valuable uses. To give a few examples,
health insurance companies can better forecast their future financial obligations
from their extensive information on the past health, use of medical resources,
and other behavior of millions of insured individuals and families. Economists
use the vast government social security data to track how earnings of different
individuals vary over the lifecycle, and even how the earnings of children are
related to those of their parents. Governments use their extensive information
on incomes and deductions to discover who is likely to be underreporting their
incomes and over reporting their deductions to tax authorities.

Yet each of these and other big data sets is subject to
abuse. Extensive health histories enable insurance companies, unless checked,
to reclassify men and women into worse health categories as they age and
experience health problems. Such reclassification takes away the prospect of
individuals getting some long term health insurance from annual
insurance contracts. Big data sets available to researchers have been manipulated
to identify individuals and corporations. Already mentioned is that governments
sometimes use extensive tax information to target individuals and groups who
oppose them. The information from government surveillance cameras, as Posner
indicates, may be improperly used for political advantage, as when cameras
detect well-known political leaders in cars with women who are not their
spouses.

Fortunately, the Internet, social media, and other modern
technologies are not only a major source of the big data that is sometimes used
for bad purposes, but these technologies often also help expose these abuses.
Individuals who become privy to damaging information about governmental (or
private) behavior can publicize that behavior on the Internet to vast audiences. For example, since information about these events is quickly posted online,The Internet has forced China to admit to events that in the
past would have been kept secret, such as governmental land grabs, protests
against local pollution levels, local health epidemics, and deaths from mining
disasters,

How to harness big data to socially valuable purposes while
keeping down abuses is becoming an important priority in democratic societies.
The Internet is an important source of big data, but it also is an increasingly valuable way to control the abuses.

"Privacy"? What Privacy? Dare we say, "Hi Big Brother". I'm just waiting for them to begin implanting "Data Chips" in our skulls at birth. Learn to embrace the new "Order"; it will make life so much easier for all...

This is just one incident that was made public knowledge. It's probable that incidents such as this have happened and are currently happening.

Only way to fix it is more transparency, more internal controls, more people who speak up about these incidents, and less corrupt people (least likely to happen).

We wouldn't know..We cannot control anything and there is no guarantee that the same incident won't happen again in the future..This is really frustrating.
