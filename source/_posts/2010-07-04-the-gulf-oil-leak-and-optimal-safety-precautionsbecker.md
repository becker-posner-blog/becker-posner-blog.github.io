Economists over the years have had a schizophrenic attitude
toward low probability but highly costly events. One school of thought argues
that most people give less attention to such events than is merited, and that
this explains why many households do not to take out flood, earthquake, and
other insurance on very small risks (although there may be other explanations
of this fact). Some psychologists and economics claim the opposite, that people give too much attention to low
probability events, as in much of modern behavioral economics.

Whether BP paid enough attention to the chances of and
damages from a serious leak on its Deepwater Horizon rig in the Gulf of Mexico
is at the heart of any evaluation of whether BP was negligent in its safety
approaches to this well. The chief executive of BP, Tony Hayward, claimed that
an accident of the magnitude of this one had “a one in a million” chance. It is
ironic that when Hayward became chief executive, he vowed to focus “like a
laser” on safety and reliable operations.

Suppose that his estimate is correct, in the sense that the
probability of an accident of this magnitude in any year was one in a million.
If the accident ends up causing a $100 billion worth of damages to fish,
beaches, loss of lives, and in other ways, the discounted value (at a 5%
interest rate) of this expected cost over time would then be approximately 20
times $100 billion divided by one million, or $2 million. A risk neutral BP
would rationally not want to spend more than that amount to prevent such a leak
from happening. Perhaps the damages from this oil spill will turn out to be as
much as $200 billion, although this seems highly unlikely, especially since the
value of BP’s shares have declined by about $90 billion since the April 20th
disaster. Even if the damages were more than twice as large as the decline in
share value, the expected damages would only be about $4 million, a modest
expected risk for any large business.

Of course, to justify their poor preparation to combat such
a large leak of oil, Hayward may have greatly understated its probability. As
Posner emphasizes, it is very difficult to estimate with any precision what is
the actual probability of highly infrequent events, and such a leak would fall
within this class. So if the annual probability were really more like 1/10,000
rather than 1/1,000,000, the expected discounted cost would be about $200
million, a more considerable sum. These examples show that only when the annual
probability of such a disaster was reasonably large would it have paid for BP
to spend a lot to prevent such a leak from happening.

Given the litigation that resulted from the 1989 Exxon
Valdez oil spill off Alaska, and from other oil leaks, BP should have expected
that it would be held liable in court for the damages caused by leaks from its
deep water drilling. However, it could hardly have expected to be liable for
new types of claims, such as the one proposed by the Obama administration that
BP should be responsible for the wages lost by workers who are laid off as a
result of the six month moratorium proclaimed by the president on all drilling
off the American coast. It is ironic that Obama had on March 31st,
just a few weeks before the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in April, proposed an
extension of offshore drilling. Nevertheless, if the Deepwater leak alerted us
to greater risks of offshore drilling than had been realized, BP should not be
punished for (inadvertently) providing this useful information.

The president may be right in asking for a moratorium to
spend a few months reviewing the safety precautions on all drilling off the US
coastline. However, it would be unfortunate if this disaster led to permanently
much greater restrictions by the US on offshore drilling for oil since that is
at present the most promising source of additional US production of oil. The
likelihood, and cost, of future spills has to be weighed against the gains to
US national security and energy independence from having greater access to
domestically produced oil. Since I believe these gains are substantial, I
expect offshore oil production to continue to have an important place in US
(and other countries) production of oil since offshore oil is the last frontier
in the search for new deposits of oil.

Deepwater offshore E&P makes fundamentally a lot more sense than hoarding up on gold, doesn't it, Mr. John Paulson and Mr. George Soros?

Does your calculation assume a $200 billion damage per YEAR in perpetuity?

oooops - I should have specified $100 billion per YEAR in perpetuity.

Great article about the probabilities of such a disaster.  

It's disconcerting how this is yet another "million to one" accident according to BP, given their horrendous safety record.

Infrequent high risk events are difficult to place a probability on but this reminds me of the comments from Richard Feynman on the NASA Challenger disaster review... he said it was going to happen again and NASA provided their analysis that it was highly improbable... well it happened again.  In the case of this oil spill it would be prudent to be properly prepared for another.

Probabilities of 1/10,000 to 1/20,000 are reasonable and the 1/1,000,000 figure is just your typical corporate CEO rhetoric.

The BP Oil spill shows that safety is not an add on, its just good business.  Put aside the repair costs, the clean up costs, the compensation that will be paid.  You can even forget the loss of production.  How much damage has been done to be BP brand out of this incident.  They have received negative publicity day after day, week after week, right across the world.

Risk Management, Emergency Preparedness and Safety Compliance are not nice-to-haves, they are crucial components to ensuring an organisation's sustainability.

This season the going has not been so good for Berba. Berbatov  has been generally an overrated player in my opinion. Also, I always sensed that Dimitar Berbatov   really should have been shown the door instead of Carlos Tevez. Actions speaks more louder than words. Currently, there exists too much competetion in the strikers line up. Hernandez, Obertan, Macheda and Bebe can easily fill up any vacancy. Berba wont be missed and infact we'll become much better off with the final result. There are actually younger players who are willing to give 110 PERCENTS for United and I have never felt Berbatov do this even when he has scored goals for us. If Berba   is smart which I dont think he is, this is the correct time for him to move on as he's not getting any younger and famous.

I define soviet-style capitalism as economic behavior driven by unbounded greed, devoid of ethical consideration, purely selfish in nature, with concern only for short-term profits, and with no thought to the long-term interests of clients, minority shareholders, or society in general.
