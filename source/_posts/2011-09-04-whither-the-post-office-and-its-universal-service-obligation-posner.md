Becker is certainly correct that the U.S. Postal Service should be privatized. Although government is probably more efficient at providing some services than private enterprise is, such as the military, national security intelligence, the police, the judiciary, the central bank, and prisons, because the output of these services is so difficult to measure, there is no reason to think it any more efficient at providing postal service than it would be at providing telephone service or airline service. Its origins as a public service reflect government concern with conspiracies (and its desire therefore to be able to read letters in transit), the natural-monopoly character of postal service (multiple postal services would require duplication of delivery trucks, post offices, and sorting stations), and the desire to provide universal service at flat rates in order to improve information flow throughout the entire society (i.e., to achieve network externalities).

Later, when the telegraph and telephone were invented, it became recognized that these desiderata could be achieved without public ownership. AT&T until its breakup in the early 1980s had a de facto monopoly of telephone service, providing universal local service at flat rates subsidized by long-distance service and shielded by regulatory agencies (primarily the Federal Communications Commission) from competition by “cream skimmers” (competitors entering the service markets in which rates were kept artifically high in order to subsidize local service, especially local service in sparsely inhabited areas), but constrained in its ability to obtain monopoly profits by regulatory control of rates.

This could have been the regime for postal service, and an important step in the direction of substituting a government-regulated for a government-owned postal service was the 1971 reform that converted the service from a Cabinet department to an independent agency that was to be self-financing (largely from the sale of stamps) rather than dependent on congressional appropriations. The universal service obligation remained, along with a legal monopoly of first- and third-class mail and of access to post boxes (as distinct from front-door mail slots), and continues to this day.

But just as AT&T was eaten away by cream skimmers owing to liberalized regulation in the 1970s, so that by the beginning of the next decade it was ready to embrace a large measure of deregulation, so the postal service is being destroyed by competition from unregulated services, mainly email and other online services but also fax and Federal Express. Its revenues are plummeting faster than it has been able to cut costs. As a result, according to an article in today’s New York Times, “the [postal service] is so low on cash that it will not be able to make a $5.5 billion payment due this month and may have to shut down entirely this winter unless Congress takes emergency action to stabilize its finances.” The article discusses various economies, as well as congressional subsidy, that might save the postal service—but does not mention privatization as a possibility.

The postal service is hobbled in competing by its universal service obligation, which requires it to maintain post offices and fleets of delivery trucks in remote areas of  the country that generate little in the way of postal revenue, and to pick up and deliver mail six days a week. And since email, fax, and Federal Express service are available everywhere, the case for subsidizing postal service to remote areas is weak.

The federal government could no doubt sell the postal service, just as states are busy selling turnpikes and bridges. If it sold it subject to the buyer’s assuming the universal service obligation, it would have to convey along with the postal service's physical assets its monopoly protections against cream skimming—the monopoly of first- and third-class mail and exclusive access to post boxes. But then little would have been achieved by the sale—not nothing, because the buyer would be more strongly motivated than government to seek economies, but not a lot.

A sale without conditions would be different—the results would be radical: a large reduction in post offices and delivery trucks, and correspondingly large reductions in numbers of employees. But then what of the people living in remote areas? Email and fax are not a complete answer, because there is still a demand for letters, magazines, advertising brochures, and other items of snail mail. All these are things that can be delivered by Fed Ex or UPS, but the price for pick up and delivery in remote areas might be quite high. There is no good economic reason to subsidize people who decide to live in remote areas, but there would be political pressures to do so.

As a practical matter, reform of the postal service should I think proceed in three stages over a period of years. In the first stage, the postal service should be allowed to charge double postage for mail to or from designated remote areas and to terminate Saturday mail service to and from those areas. In the second, the postal service should be sold to private enterprise but with the legal restrictions (universal service, in its modified form with double postage and no Saturday delivery in remote areas, and exclusive access to post boxes) intact. And in the third the legal restrictions should be removed and all postal service be open to competition.

    Posner proposes a three stage reform for the postal service.  The first and second stages are basically sound although one wonders why selling the post office to a private enterprise seems like such a priority to both Posner and Becker when Posner acknowledges that "the buyer would be more strongly motivated than government to seek economies, but not a lot."

    Perhaps it is because of the third stage of Posner's proposal that calls for the postal service to "be open to competition" and removing some legal restrictions related to remote area delivery and so forth.

    The natural monopoly characteristics of the postal service suggests that a selective outsourcing of certain functions might be more workable than open competition.  Furthermore, Posner makes note of the network externalities associated with the post office monopoly on letter mail but he does not elaborate much on how those positive externalities might be eroded by competition.

Your Honor,

This reminds me of when the United Kingdom sold off much of their public transportation assets. Many of the economic arguments you present were considered back then. For the good of the nation, they made tough decisions and moved on. 

I agree that we should sell off the Post Office. It is riddled with inefficiencies such as labor relations issues. For example, each day I review the list of NLRB petitions and charges and it is sad that the Post Office labor unions file hundreds of Unfair Labor Practices each year. 

As you point out, there is a sticky constitutional issue that I hope our folks in DC can work out. 

Thanks for another great article.

Regards,
Chuck

Seemingly mindless "Chi school" "policy". 

"The postal service is hobbled in competing by its universal service obligation, which requires it to maintain post offices and fleets of delivery trucks in remote areas of  the country that generate little in the way of postal revenue, and to pick up and deliver mail six days a week."

............. and you'd propose?????  Those where it's "not profitable" to deliver the mail to do what?   Often, through out our history of "manifest destiny" our pioneering regions were "losers" for roads, mail, phone lines, and today, broadband, and with high fuel costs at risk of losing un-subsidized air service.   


And since email, fax, and Federal Express service are available everywhere, the case for subsidizing postal service to remote areas is weak.

.............. Well, truth is they are not universally available.   

The federal government could no doubt sell the postal service, just as states are busy selling turnpikes and bridges.

........... hmmm, and a business that either breaks even or loses money IF universal service is mandated is worth what to whom?  Oh....... I see the idea is that of cherry picking the juicy parts and either spinning off or casting off the "hard to serve" sectors?  Shall we ALL be forced to move to the city and nearby suburbs?


 If it sold it subject to the buyer’s assuming the universal service obligation, it would have to convey along with the postal service's physical assets its monopoly protections against cream skimming—the monopoly of first- and third-class mail and exclusive access to post boxes. But then little would have been achieved by the sale—not nothing, because the buyer would be more strongly motivated than government to seek economies, but not a lot. 

.......... Indeed.  And perhaps not EVEN more motivated. 


On Posner's "reforms":    If one day is to be dropped from the schedule perhaps mandating "Saturday" isn't the best idea as mail would have two days in a row to pile up and congest the intermediate distribution facilities.  Also in many areas the mail contract subsidizes passenger air travel, thus chopping "Saturday" might reduce the offsetting passenger revenue.  Better? Pick at local level the 4 or 5 day service.

As for "doubling postage"?  Probably foolish.  Consider, the small rural areas are a small, small percentage of  the overall mail delivery task.  So we'd ADD more confusion to the public, adding more trips to the PO "to be sure of getting it right" more sorting and of course more sending back for more postage.

No........ the RIGHT direction as all Ebayers know is that of fixed rates for standardized boxes that saves time for all concerned.  In fact they should provide larger "std boxes" than the current 12 x 12 and smaller.  Consider, both shipper and buyer then understand and can advertise "std 10.95 postage" for the article that fits that box.

Oh, and Chuck? The day after L A B O R  D A Y is hardly the day to illustrate your lack of understanding American labor issues with "riddled with inefficiencies such as labor relations issues."  As many know private industry too has to deal with "pesky" "labor issues".

Universal Service? A thing of the past if the USPS is done away with and mail delivery is privatized. I remember one phrase from a German Officer in the Wehrmacht from a memoir, "We knew the War was lost when we discovered a box containing a homemade chocolate cake from some mother in a little town in the Midwest that had traveled over some 7,000 miles and made it to the trenches in the frontlines and we couldn't even get basic supplies from a 100 miles away". I can remember getting a box of peanutbutter cookies from my Grandmother in Ohio while I was in College in Illinois via the USPS. Although, they got to me as crumbs. I'm still looking for that "rat" in the University Mail Services...

We can debate the rate at which the post service is becoming obsolete in the face of new technologies, but it IS happening.  This is no mystery.  An appropriate management response to a structural drop in demand is a structural drop in supply.  The service is still possibly necessary, but it is not crucial.  Mail can come one day later and the world will not self-destruct.

So, suppose we move to a system where smaller, more rural post offices, the source of most of the losses, are open every other business day: MWF one week, TR the next.  Full-time counter and route staff could thus run two post offices.  If you really need to mail something in a hurry, go to the next town over where the post office is open that day.  If you aren't willing to do that, do a better job of planning ahead.

I'm a lawyer in a semi-rural area, with no door-to-door service.  Yesterday I went to my postal drawer for the first time in two days, and it was full - of nothing that couldn't have continued to wait.  No letters from other attorneys (we use e-mail and scanners), no bills (all paid on-line), just solicitations (a dozen nick-nack catalogs for my wife, a few credit card offers, etc.)

Maybe it's nice to get a physical birthday card, but is it important enough that the government should be able to reach into my pocket to fund that warm fuzzy feeling you like to feel when your grandchild scribbles something in crayon and sends it to you?  I do not believe it is, and I vote not to use my tax money to subsidize it.

Well Counselor, perhaps good in theory, but here in Alaska I'm familiar with a number of small town PO's.  While some of your suggestions MIGHT work "scaling down" is often as tough or tougher than scaling up.  Some PO's have but ONE person while others may have a couple doing different tasks, like running the front counter while another handles heavier back room intake and sorting.  

So........ are we likely to find those who can afford to work three days a week? 

On the other hand........ in my longer view, we're well past the time when we should have adopted a shorter work week so as to spread out our limited work.  

As for "most of the losses" perhaps the rural offices do lose more per letter or pkg delivered, but they are also a smaller, percentage, part of the overall problem. 

As the mail contracts often subsidize air, boat or other service we'd want to consider what cutting would mean to those towns.

Norway...... after WWII realized (or thought) that rural population added to their security from neighboring expansionists, so encouraged fish farming and other programs meant to increase rural population.   We have a declining rural population and may want to consider whether that is a good trend.

To follow up with Jack, my comment of 9/10 was suggesting a reasoned step toward the inevitable obsolescence of the post office, by cutting the number of rural route employees in half.

I.e., John and Joe are two mailmen walking routes.  We fire Joe, and John remains a full-time employee.  John then walks his own route MWF, and Joe's route TR; the next week, he walks his own route TR, and Joe's MWF.  I guess I didn't say that clearly before.

Like Jack, I live among several post offices staffed by one person each.  I can envision pairing them up as I described above, with each one closing every other day, and firing half the staff.  We're still stuck with all the buildings for a while, till the next reduction in service in parallel with the continuing drop in demand, maybe 10 years from now, but at least buildings do not collect retirement and health benefits.

One important benefit of this approach is that it preserves universal service, which is what we were discussing in the first place.  If the NYC post office goes out of business it will create no disruption at all, because UPS will gladly provide service to every address there.  Not true in Alaska which is an outlier, in every sense, and may need special consideration and a more tailored solution.

The USPS carries less mail than it once did, but more to the point it carries far less mail of any importance than it once did.  It may at some point, now or in the near future, be more of a service to our rural citizens if we ensure universal Internet connectivity instead of universal mail service.  (It may also be cheaper.)

Papavero, un innovativo add-on per voi per cricca di Quentin, non ha senso accuratamente consegnato. Così come Janet, il numero di difficile pubblicazione all'interno del primo, è quasi completamente assente con il procedimento qui. "King" allo stesso modo non sembra davvero dato letterario o anche finito, mentre il predecessore. Il tracciato attuale è marginalmente più esistente, la pubblicazione di particolari un po 'optate molto meno sfarzoso.

You're typical of the reason legal and judicial systems were invented: you think you know who did it but you don't think at all. Afghanistan and Pakistan are rife with pockets of cultures who believe "justice" should be in the individuals' or families' own hands - even when they're wrong.
