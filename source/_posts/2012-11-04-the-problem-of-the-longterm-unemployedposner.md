It is straightforward to enumerate bad effects of beingunemployed for a long time, such as erosion of skills, loss of contacts, andreluctance of employers to hire a person who has been unemployed for a longtime (this is because employers often use a person’s having been unemployed fora long time as a signal of lack of commitment to or fitness for employment).But it is difficult to make a precise estimate of the gravity of the problem.

For one thing, there is no nonarbitrary definition of “longterm.” Is it six months? (Many women are out of the work force for longerbecause they have young children, yet do find jobs when they return, albeitoften at a lower wage than if they had remained in the labor force continuously.)A year? One would have to know the average rate at which job skills erode,contacts diminish, or potential employers’ suspicions grow, to be able to determinethe economically meaningful cut off.

And even if this hurdle could be surmounted, it is unclearwho actually is “unemployed” and who simply has left the work force (retiredearly, become a housewife or house husband and thus substituted householdproduction for paid work, become disabled, or interrupted work to go to collegeor to a professional school). The number of people who are unemployed in theBureau of Labor Statistics sense—not employed at present, but looking forwork—understates the number of long-term unemployed, because some of thelong-term unemployed have become discouraged, ceased looking for work, and thusare no longer counted as unemployed. No one knows for sure how many suchdiscouraged workers there are, but the Bureau of Labor Statistics estimatesthat there currently are 800,000 id rgwn. This actually is rather few relativeto the 5 million long-term unemployed, that is, unemployed who are stilllooking for work.

Notice too that people who leaves the labor force are notnecessarily unemployed in an economic sense. Household production is real.Apart from the obvious examples, a person who retires early to help withraising a grandchild, thus freeing up the parents to devote more time to paidwork, is productively though not formally employed. This is true even if theperson is still looking for a paid job, and regards his stint as a householdproducer as temporary. The difficulty of valuing the household production ofthe long-term unemployed makes the cost of long-term unemployment to theeconomy difficult to assess, although it is certainly positive.

A final problem in estimating the social costs of long-termunemployment is measuring the long term. Here one should distinguish betweenlong-term unemployed in the BLS sense—unemployed for a long time but stilllooking for work—and unemployed who have stopped looking for work, whom the BLSas I said calls discouraged workers. The unemployment rate in the United Stateswas very high throughout the 1930s, and many of the unemployed must have beenunemployed for years, yet that doesn’t seem to have left a residue of discouraged,prematurely retired workers. Eventually most of them must have found jobs, andnot just during the World War II labor shortage, since low unemploymentpersisted after the war ended. Surprisingly, of the 5 million long-termunemployed still looking for jobs today, 1.7 million have been unemployed formore than 99 weeks—and they are still looking. As the economy continues torecover, assuming it does so, more will look for—and find—jobs. According tothe latest BLS statistics, in the past year the number of discouraged workershas dropped by 16 percent, from 967,000 to 813,000. That is a promising sign.

Long-term unemployment may turn out not to have a long-termeffect on the economy. Or may—for even though the economy has improved over thepast year, the number of long-term unemployed (the 5 million) has not declined.This may reflect a reduced demand for workers, because of automation and (asBecker points out) decline of manufacturing, which are economic changesindependent, or largely so, of the depressed state of the U.S. economy asa whole.

The long-term economic effects of the long-term unemployed (whoever they are) may indeed be survivable.  No doubt we will eventually get through this and it will be back to the old Upward and Onward.  I am not so sure the fate of the depressed souls going through this will be equally cheery, however.  But that is a subject for novelists, not Darwinians.

I noticed, at least to me, that if you are not hired for a longer period of time, then you've got no desire to do so.

 "...there currently are 800,000 id rgwn" is a touch-typist's way of saying, "...there currently are 800,000 of them."

Long term unemployment could be caused by a recession and a mixture of other things as well. Then they are less likely to get re-hired. However, new research by economists has shown that there is more movement around the labor force than people thought there was. Barack's new policies are starting to take effect and the long termed unemployed are starting to pay more attention to seeking jobs. Statistics state that there is actually a reduction in long-term unemployment as well. Originally there was 6.2 million people not looking for jobs and it is currently 4.8 million now.
