"
CASEY WIAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Say "Costco" and most Americans think big-box discount retailer. But another COSCO without the "T" operates at the Port of Long Beach, California, and the China ocean shipping company is controlled by the government of Communist China. Through a joint venture with the U.S. Stevedoring Company, COSCO operates one of the largest container terminals on the West Coast.

Across the harbor at the Port of Los Angeles, another Chinese government-owned company, China Shipping, operates its own 75-acre port terminal facility. Port terminal operators are responsible for implementing homeland security procedures. "
