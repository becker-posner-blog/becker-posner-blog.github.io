I would like to see a post on terrorism, the First Amendment, and advocacy of violence in the name of religion, perhaps in specific reference to the terrorist attacks in London.

You two are wonderful for taking the time to write this blog. I really enjoy your posts.

I, too, would be interested in reading your thoughts on terrorism and the First Amendment -- specifically, finding an optimal balance with respect to national security "investigatory tools" and civil liberties. As the NYTimes has reported (see their editorial today), Congress is about to renew certain provisions of the Patriot Act.

I am enjoying the site as well.  I would be interested in reading your thoughts on the (much maligned) Laffer Curve and how some are asserting its relevancy to the latest reports concerning Federaltax receipts.  Are these recent numbers vindication for Prof. Laffer?

Thank you.

While folks are making requests, I've been interested for a while in the reconciliation between some religious views and scientific findings in this country.  The evolutionist/creationist debates come to mind, but I'm sure there are others.  

The trouble as I see it is that we put a value on the rights of individuals' to their religious beliefs and try to keep government from commenting or legislating religion.  But at the same time, we have a clear interest in promoting scientific advance and education, both for economic reasons and because it may have value of its own.   

I alo think a discusion of the Laffer Curve per Eric's suggestion would be swell.

This blog is such a great idea, and I thoroughly enjoy the more "direct" dialogue that both of you provide on the site.  I especially liked both of your positions regarding Immigration, as they provided very interesting ideas.  However, I was wondering if either of you had comment on the topic of the intersecting issues of Immigration and Criminal behavior?

As you know, there is a tension between labor protections (under National Labor Relations Act and the like) and IRCAís criminalization of undocumented workers, because such workers are technically entitled to rights under the labor statutes, but are less and less able to avail themselves of the traditional remedies available under these Acts (particularly after the Supreme Courtís 2002 Hoffman Plastics decision).  

As such, Iíd like to know where either of you comes down on these issues?  Do you agree with Hoffman Plastics, or do you have a different vision about how labor and immigration laws ought to interact?

If you have to do it, you might as well do it right.
