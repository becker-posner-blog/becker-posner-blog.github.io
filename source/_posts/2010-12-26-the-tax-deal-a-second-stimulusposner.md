The Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization and Job Creation Act of 2010, which President Obama signed into law on December 17, is being described as an $858 billion stimulus bill. But this is imprecise.

The immensely complex Act is well summarized in “CCH Tax Briefing: The 2010 Tax Relief / Job Creation Act,” Dec. 20, 2010, http://tax.cchgroup.com/downloads/files/pdfs/legislation/bush-taxcuts.pdf (visited Dec. 25, 2010), which provides the following breakdown of the costs of the two-year program

Individual Tax Cuts .............$ 186 billion

AMT Relief ............................$ 136 billion

Payroll Tax Deduction ..............$ 111 billion

Estate/Gift Tax Relief .............$   68 billion

Capital Gains/

Dividend Cuts .......................$  53 billion

Bonus Depreciation/179

Expensing ............................$  21 billion

Other .................................$ 226 billion

In addition to this $801 billion in tax relief, the Act authorizes a $57 billion extension of unemployment insurance benefits for a maximum of 99 weeks.

All these are just estimates, since the amount of tax relief depends on incomes, the size of estates, and so forth, and the amount of unemployment benefits depends on the number of claims made.

Most of the “costs” represent simply lost tax revenues; the Act extends tax cuts, made a decade ago, that would have expired at the end of this year—but the payroll (i.e., social security) tax deduction and extension of unemployment benefits, along with some of the other tax provisions, are new tax breaks. The benefits extension will probably expire at the end of the two years in which the new Act will be in effect, as unemployment falls. The other provisions of the Act are likely to be continued, given Republican hostility to any tax increases—and refusing to extend a temporary tax cut is rightly perceived as a tax increase. The Act illustrates the nature of compromise between the Democratic and Republican parties in the current political climate: each party seeks tax reductions for its constituents (the payroll tax deduction being the Democrats’ preferred form of tax break) and the Democrats in addition seek to increase spending (hence the extension of unemployment benefits).

The aggregate federal deficit is about $14 trillion, and is increasing at a rate of about $400 billion a year. All other things unchanged, the Act, assuming permanence, will almost double the annual increase in the deficit, putting the country farther along the road to bankruptcy—unless, as the Administration argues, the Act will operate as a stimulus (Keynesian deficit spending in a depression or recession) that will bring down the deficit by accelerating economic growth.

This would be unlikely if the tax breaks were new rather than for the most part merely continuations of the Bush tax cuts of a decade ago (I explain the significance of this qualification below).

The normal (not recessionary) rate of the nation’s economic growth is about 3 percent a year, but is usually much higher in the recovery period following a depression or recession. The economy is expected to grow by only about 3 to 4 percent in 2011; if the new Act added 2 percent to the higher figure, which I don’t think anyone expects, so that the Gross Domestic Product grew by about $800 billion (6 percent of our $14 trillion GDP), this would, it is true, reduce the rate of growth of the deficit. Suppose the additional $800 billion in GDP yielded $160 billion in additional federal tax revenues (20 percent). Then the 2011 deficit, instead of being roughly $800 billion, would be “only” $640 billion—we would still be on the road to bankruptcy.

Moreover, the benefits in deficit reduction from the Act would soon peter out; there is no basis for thinking that the level of taxation in the Act, compared to the higher tax level in the 1990s, will produce a higher rate of economic growth than the normal 3 percent.

It is nevertheless possible to defend the new Act on two grounds. The first, and I think less important, is that it indicates the possibility of compromise between the Obama Administration and the resurgent, and increasingly conservative and assertive, Republican Party, though compromise will be more difficult come January when the Republicans take control of the House of Representatives and significantly increase their representation in the Senate. Second, and more important, estimates that GDP would grow by at least 3 percent in 2011 were premised on the expectation that the bulk, at least, of the Bush tax cuts would be continued. Given the weakness of the economy, a sudden tax increase in 2011, which would have been the effect of allowing those cuts to expire, could easily have knocked one or two percentage points off the GDP growth rate.

It would have been better to have just continued the tax breaks and not have cut the payroll tax and extended unemployment benefits. A small, and possibly (though not probably) temporary, tax cut is unlikely to stimulate much spending, and extending unemployment benefits can actually increase unemployment by making unemployed workers more picky in their search for a new job. These provisions of the Act are simply the Democratic quid pro quo for the tax breaks for the wealthy, favored by the Republicans.

Posner concludes with the following remarks:

"It would have been better to have just continued the tax breaks and not have cut the payroll tax and extended unemployment benefits.  A small, and possibly (though not probably) temporary, tax cut is unlikely to stimulate much spending, and extending unemployment benefits can actually increase unemployment by making unemployed workers more picky in their search for a new job.  These provisions of the Act are simply the Democratic quid pro quo for the tax breaks for the wealthy, favored by the Republicans."

**********

The first two sentences are undeniably true.  Posner goes off the rails, however, in characterizing the current system of marginal tax rates as "tax breaks for the wealthy."  He evidently forgets that Ronald Reagan (who put Posner on the federal bench) reforged the Tax Code in 1986 to provide a top tax rate of only 28%.  But Posner is not alone.  All commentators who refer to the "Bush tax cuts" conveniently neglect to mention this historical fact.

"It would have been better to have just continued the tax breaks and not have cut the payroll tax and extended unemployment benefits."

............ For whom?  Like many Americans having been both up and down, it's fairly easy to pay taxes well after a fine profit or good income year takes place. On the other hand when down as huge number are today even a few bucks during unemployment or a break on payroll taxes while (trying) to catch up. Tax breaks for those who broke us? At our expense? Great.


 ""A small, and possibly (though not probably) temporary, tax cut is unlikely to stimulate much spending,"

........... Agreed. So why gin up more deficit?

 "and extending unemployment benefits can actually increase unemployment by making unemployed workers more picky in their search for a new job."

............  Hmmm "picky you say?"  Statistically does it matter?  Joe turns down the mediocre offer while Suzie a bit more desperate takes it.  Same number still unemployed and since Suzie had little bargaining power no increase in low end pay took place and god knows we would not want wage "inflation" at the lower tiers. 

Observer: I do remember! And! The Reagan tax cuts did not pay the bills in peace time, seemingly ginned up the idea charmingly put forth by the old boy that "deficits don't matter" and certainly will not pay the bills in "wartime" or in deep recession.

Am I reading things out of context here, or is there a reversal of thinking in the span of a mere 2 paragraphs?

But honestly, as a European immigrant to the US, I’d like to hear from Dr. Posner what are in his view the fundamental economic factors that set the US apart from the other 200 countries in the world and enabled it to become so disproportionately prosperous…

That seems to me the 14 trillion question which Americans and their naiveté seem to be taking for granted (“…now that we’re prosperous we sure can afford to implement a Welfare State. Don’t we?”)

Perhaps, but given the incidence of these taxes this has to be about the least efficient stimulus possible. Too little of it is going to the segments of the population that are most likely to spend it. While I think stimulus can do a lot of good, political opposition to it has been very effective at insuring that the stimulus that does occur is targeted as poorly as possible, which, while it will lead to some growth in the short term, ultimately serves to lend historical evidence to their claims about the futility and low impact of stimulus. Due to long term impacts on the political debate, I think this kind of stimulus is worse for our country in the long term than no stimulus at all.

Judge Posner,

You say, "extending unemployment benefits can actually increase unemployment by making unemployed workers more picky in their search for a new job."

Two points.  First, while this phenomenon may be true when the economy is running at "full employment," is this really a concern when, as now, the unemployment rate is near 10%?  

Second, do you believe that the unemployment benefits have a stimulative effect by pumping dollars into the economy?  Presumably, most of the people who receive UI benefits will not be in a position to save and will thus be spending every dollar they receive.  Shouldn't this benefit be factored into your analysis?

Thank you for writing this blog.

Stephen: Not likely that Posner will reply, but I'd say you have it exactly right.  If say unemployed guy #10 million has the temerity to turn down a miserable offer one of the other desperadoes is likely to take it.  

You'll remember that Econ tells us that in a market of many sellers and few buyers that the individual seller is a "price taker" not a market maker.  In street talk you can spot the effect quickly: When you hear "What are "they" paying for ....... some un or semi-skilled task, or a truckload of potatoes"  the price will be set by the employer or buyer.  When  you hear  "Well, WE sat down an negotiated a compensation package....." well you see the difference! 

UI is CLEARLY a shock absorber for the economy.  When the typically, lip deep in debt, guy is laid off it's a combo of UI and perhaps spousal employment that keeps the car and house off the foreclosure list.  You can imagine the ripple effect of millions of "Smart Leases" and repo's clogging up the car lots! Not easy to sell a new gashog when there's a lot full of good two year old units!

Lastly, exactly, lower incomes, be it UI related or other have the highest propensity to spend the next buck to land on their kitchen table.  You've surely experienced the effect yourself, in a good year a tax rebate may sit there uncashed for a while and then be banked, mebbe for Jr's schooling a LONG time hence. That's why continuing the (unaffordable) tax cuts for the top 2% was a WASTE in terms of "bang for the buck" spurring.  That was an example of pure clout amplified by a large dollop of greed.  To get OUT of this mess requires getting the absolute max out of EVERY buck.

Hopes for 2011, Jack

McCarthy ripped off A Boy and His Dog for The Road?! Ridiculous. Pathetic. Absolutely without foundation, and just another bent nail in the coffin of Harlan's rep and legacy. He makes me so mad. Why doesn't he finish one of his damn unseen opuses? Instead he prefers to yell "Thief, thief," at the end of his days.

Bottom line, a tax increase would shave several percentage points off any GDP growth.  Not what we need right now.

These tax cuts are incredible, I can't beleive that corporations require such frivolous things. How can it be that they need tax cuts, they earn so much. These companies are so damn useless, I swear....

those parents split up at higher rates. That is dangerous and unsupported territory, unsupported if only because there is not enough data - openly gay couples raising children being a relatively new phenomenon. A couple staying married throughout their childrens' youth does not necessarily equal a happily-married couple. Many couples stay together "for the kids," which often breeds resentment which is often directed at the marriage partner. I would venture that kids observing this dynamic growing up might have more problems forming healthy adult relationships than those exposed to a happily-married gay couple, even if that couple eventually splits up
